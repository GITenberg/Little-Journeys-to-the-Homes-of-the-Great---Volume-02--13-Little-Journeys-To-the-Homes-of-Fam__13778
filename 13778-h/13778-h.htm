<div class="blkquot"><p>We are not sent into this world to do anything into
which we can not put our hearts. We have certain
work to do for our bread and that is to be done strenuously,
other work to do for our delight and that is to
be done heartily; neither is to be done by halves or
shifts, but with a will; and what is not worth this effort
is not to be done at all.<br />
<span style='margin-left: 10em;'>&mdash;<i>John Ruskin</i></span></p></div>

<p><br /><a name="II_Page_5"></a></p>
<p>I am Elbert Hubbard's son, and I
am entirely familiar with the proposition
that &quot;Genius never reproduces.&quot;</p>

<p>Heretofore, it has always been necessary
to sign my name, &quot;Elbert
Hubbard II&quot;&mdash;but now there is an
embarrassment in that signature,
an assumption that I do not feel.</p>

<p>There is no Second Elbert Hubbard. To five hundred
Roycrofters, to the Village of East Aurora, and to a
few dozen personal friends scattered over the face of
the earth, I am Bert Hubbard, plain Bert Hubbard&mdash;and
as Bert Hubbard I want to be known to you.</p>

<p>I lay no claim to having inherited Elbert Hubbard's
Genius, his Personality, his Insight into the Human
Heart. I am another and totally different sort of man.</p>

<p>I know my limitations.</p>

<p>Also, I am acquainted with such ability as I possess,
and I believe that it can be directed to serve you.</p>

<p>I got my schooling in East Aurora.</p>

<p>I have never been to College. But I have traveled across
this Country several times with my Father.</p>

<p>I have
traveled abroad with him. One time we walked from
Edinburgh to London to prove that we could do it.</p>

<p>My Father has been my teacher&mdash;and I do not at all
<a name="II_Page_6"></a>envy the College Man.</p>

<p>For the last twenty years I
have been working in the Roycroft Shops.</p>

<p>I believe
I am well grounded in Business&mdash;also, in Work.</p>

<p>When I was twelve years old my father transferred Ali
Baba to the garden&mdash;and I did the chores around the
house and barn for a dollar a week. From that day
forward I earned every dollar that ever came to me.</p>

<p>I fed the printing-press at four dollars a week. Then,
when we purchased a gas-engine, I was promoted to be
engineer, and given a pair of long overalls.</p>

<p>Two or three years later I was moved into the General
Office, where I opened mail and filled in orders.</p>

<p>Again, I was promoted into the Private Office and
permitted to sign my name under my Father's, on
checks.</p>

<p>Then the responsibility of purchasing materials
was given me.</p>

<p>One time or another I have worked in every Department
of the Roycroft Shops.</p>

<p>My association with Elbert Hubbard has been friendly,
brotherly. I have enjoyed his complete confidence&mdash;and
I have tried to deserve it.</p>

<p>He believed in me, loved me, hoped for me. Whether
I disappointed him at times is not important. I know
my average must have pleased him, because the night
he said Farewell to the Roycrofters he spoke well of
me, very well of me, and he left the Roycroft Institution
in my charge.</p>

<p>He sailed away on the &quot;Lusitania&quot; intending to be
<a name="II_Page_7"></a>gone several weeks. His Little Journey has been prolonged
into Eternity.</p>

<p>But the work of Elbert and Alice Hubbard is not done.
With them one task was scarcely under way when
another was launched. Whether complete or incomplete,
there had to be an end to their effort sometime, and this
is the end.</p>

<p>Often Elbert Hubbard would tell the story of Tolstoy,
who stopped at the fence to question the worker in the
field, &quot;My Man, if you knew you were to die tomorrow,
what would you do today?&quot; And the worker begrimed
with sweat would answer, &quot;I would plow!&quot;</p>

<p>That's the way Elbert Hubbard lived and died, and
yet he did more&mdash;he planned for the future. He planned
the future of the Roycroft Shop. Death did not meet
him as a stranger. He came as a sometime-expected
friend. Father was not unprepared.</p>

<p>The plan that would have sustained us the seven weeks
he was in Europe will sustain us seven years&mdash;and
another seven years.</p>

<p>Elbert Hubbard's work will go on.</p>

<p>I know of no Memorial that would please Elbert Hubbard
half so well as to broaden out the Roycroft Idea.</p>

<p>So we will continue to make handmade Furniture,
hand-hammered Copper, Modeled Leather. We shall
still triumph in the arts of Printing and Bookmaking.</p>

<p>The Roycroft Inn will continue to swing wide its welcoming
door, and the kind greeting is always here for you.</p>

<p>&quot;<a name="II_Page_8"></a>The Fra&quot; will not miss an issue, and you who have
enjoyed it in the past will continue to enjoy it!</p>

<p>&quot;The Philistine&quot; belonged to Elbert Hubbard. He
wrote it himself for just twenty years and one month.
No one else could have done it as he did. No one else
can now do it as he did.</p>

<p>So, for very sentimental reasons&mdash;which overbalance
the strong temptation to continue &quot;The Philistine&quot;&mdash;I
consider it a duty to pay him the tribute of discontinuing
the little Magazine of Protest.</p>

<p>The Roycrofters, Incorporated, is a band of skilled
men and women. For years they have accomplished the
work that has invited your admiration. You may expect
much of them now. The support they have given me,
the confidence they have in me, is as a great mass of
power and courage pushing me on to success.</p>

<p>This thought I would impress upon you: It will not be
the policy of The Roycrofters to imitate or copy. This
place from now on is what we make it. The past is past,
the future spreads a golden red against the eastern sky.</p>

<p>I have the determination to make a Roycroft Shop&mdash;that
Elbert Hubbard, leaning out over the balcony, will
look down and say, &quot;Good boy, Bert&mdash;good boy!&quot;</p>

<p>I have Youth and Strength.</p>

<p>I have Courage.</p>

<p>My Head is up.</p>

<p>Forward&mdash;all of us&mdash;March!</p>

<p>Writers of biography usually begin
their preachments with the rather
startling statement, &quot;The subject
of this memoir was born&quot;&mdash;&mdash;Here
follows a date, the name of the place
and a cheerful little Mrs. Gamp
anecdote: this as preliminary to
&quot;launching forth.&quot;</p>

<p>It was the merry Andrew Lang, I believe, who filed a
general protest against these machine-made biographies,
pleading that it was perfectly safe to assume the
man was born; and as for the time and place it mattered
little. But the merry man was wrong, for Time
and Place are often masters of Fate.</p>

<p>For myself, I rather like the good old-fashioned way
of beginning at the beginning. But I will not tell where
and when Elizabeth was born, for I do not know. And
I am quite sure that her husband did not know. The
encyclopedias waver between London and Herefordshire,
just according as the writers felt in their hearts
that genius should be produced in town or country.
One man, with opinions pretty well ossified on this subject,
having been challenged for his statement that
Mrs. Browning was born at Hope End, rushed into
print in a letter to the &quot;Gazette&quot; with the countercheck
quarrelsome to the effect, &quot;You might as well expect
<a name="II_Page_18"></a>throstles to build nests on Fleet Street 'buses, as for
folks of genius to be born in a big city.&quot; As apology for
the man's ardor I will explain that he was a believer in
the Religion of the East and held that spirits choose
their own time and place for materialization.</p>

<p>Mrs. Ritchie, authorized by Mr. Browning, declared
Burn Hill, Durham, the place, and March Sixth, Eighteen
Hundred Nine, the time. In reply, John H. Ingram
brings forth a copy of the Tyne &quot;Mercury,&quot; for March
Fourteenth, Eighteen Hundred Nine, and points to
this:</p>

<p>&quot;In London, the wife of Edward M. Barrett, of a
daughter.&quot;</p>

<p>Mr. Browning then comes forward with a fact that
derricks can not budge, that is, &quot;Newspapers have
ever had small regard for truth.&quot; Then he adds, &quot;My
wife was born March Sixth, Eighteen Hundred Six,
at Carlton Hall, Durham, the residence of her father's
brother.&quot; One might ha' thought that this would be
the end on't, but it wasn't, for Mr. Ingram came out
with this sharp rejoinder: &quot;Carlton Hall was not in
Durham, but in Yorkshire. And I am authoritatively
informed that it did not become the residence of
S. Moulton Barrett until some time after Eighteen
Hundred Ten. Mr. Browning's latest suggestions in
this matter can not be accepted. In Eighteen Hundred
Six, Edward Barrett, not yet twenty years of age, is
scarcely likely to have already been the father of the two
<a name="II_Page_19"></a>children assigned to him.&quot; And there the matter rests.
Having told this much I shall proceed to launch forth.</p>

<p>The earlier years of Elizabeth Barrett's life were spent
at Hope End, near Ledbury, Herefordshire. I visited
the place and thereby added not only one day, but
several to my life, for Ali counts not the days spent in
the chase. There is a description of Hope End written
by an eminent clergyman, to whom I was at once
attracted by his literary style. This gentleman's diction
contains so much clearness, force and elegance
that I can not resist quoting him verbatim: &quot;The
residentiary buildings lie on the ascent of the contiguous
eminences, whose projecting parts and bending
declivities, modeled by Nature, display astonishing
harmoniousness. It contains an elegant profusion of
wood, disposed in the most careless yet pleasing order;
much of the park and its scenery is in view of the residence,
from which vantage-point it presents a most
agreeable appearance to the enraptured beholder.&quot;
So there you have it!</p>

<p>Here Elizabeth Barrett lived until she was twenty.
She never had a childhood&mdash;'t was dropped out of her
life in some way, and a Greek grammar inlaid instead.
Of her mother we know little. She is never quoted;
never referred to; her wishes were so whisperingly
expressed that they have not reached us. She glides, a
pale shadow, across the diary pages. Her husband's
will was to her supreme; his whim her conscience. We
<a name="II_Page_20"></a>know that she was sad, often ill, that she bore eight
children. She passed out seemingly unwept, unhonored
and unsung, after a married existence of sixteen years.</p>

<p>Elizabeth Barrett had the same number of brothers
and sisters that Shakespeare had; and we know no
more of the seven Barretts who were swallowed by
oblivion than we do of the seven Shakespeares that
went not astray.</p>

<p>Edward Moulton Barrett had a sort of fierce, passionate,
jealous affection for his daughter Elizabeth. He
set himself the task of educating her from her very
babyhood. He was her constant companion, her tutor,
adviser, friend. When six years old she studied Greek,
and when nine made translations in verse. Mr. Barrett
looked on this sort of thing with much favor, and
tightened his discipline, reducing the little girl's hours
for study to a system as severe as the laws of Draco.
Of course, the child's health broke. From her thirteenth
year she appears to us like a beautiful spirit with an
astral form; or she would, did we not perceive that
this beautiful form is being racked with pain. No wonder
some one has asked, &quot;Where then was the Society
for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children?&quot;</p>

<p>But this brave spirit did not much complain. She had
a will as strong as her father's, and felt a Spartan pride
in doing all that he asked and a little more. She studied,
wrote, translated, read and thought.</p>

<p>And to spur
her on and to stimulate her, Mr. Barrett published
<a name="II_Page_21"></a>several volumes of her poems. It was immature, pedantic
work, but still it had a certain glow and gave
promise of the things yet to come.</p>

<p>One marked event in the life of Elizabeth Barrett
occurred when Hugh Stuart Boyd arrived at Hope
End. He was a fine, sensitive, soul&mdash;a poet by nature
and a Greek scholar of repute. He came on Mr. Barrett's
invitation to take Mr. Barrett's place as tutor.
The young girl was confined to her bed through the
advice of physicians; Boyd was blind.</p>

<p>Here at once was a bond of sympathy. No doubt this
break in the monotony of her life gave fresh courage
to the fair young woman. The gentle, sightless poet
relaxed the severe hours of study. Instead of grim
digging in musty tomes they talked: he sat by her
bedside holding the thin hands (for the blind see by
the sense of touch), and they talked for hours&mdash;or
were silent, which served as well. Then she would
read to the blind man and he would recite to her, for
he had the blind Homer's memory. She grew better,
and the doctors said that if she had taken her medicine
regularly, and not insisted on getting up and walking
about as guide for the blind man, she might have gotten entirely well.</p>

<p>In that fine poem, &quot;Wine of Cyprus,&quot; addressed to
Boyd, we see how she acknowledges his goodness.
There is no wine equal to the wine of friendship; and
love is only friendship&mdash;plus something else. There is
<a name="II_Page_22"></a>nothing so hygienic as friendship.</p>

<p>Hell is a separation,
and Heaven is only a going home to our friends.</p>

<p>Mr. Barrett's fortune was invested in sugar-plantations
in Jamaica. Through the emancipation of the blacks his
fortune took to itself wings. He had to give up his
splendid country home&mdash;to break the old ties. It was
decided that the family should move to London.
Elizabeth had again taken to her bed. The mattress on
which she lay was borne down the steps by four men;
one man might have carried her alone, for she weighed
only eighty-five pounds, so they say.</p>
<p><a name="II_Page_23"></a></p>
<hr />

<p>Crabb Robinson, who knew everything
and everybody, being very much such a
man as John Kenyon, has left on record the
fact that Mr. Kenyon had a face like a
Benedictine monk, a wit that never lagged, a generous
heart, and a tongue that ran like an Alpine cascade.</p>

<p>A razor with which you can not shave may have better
metal in it than one with a perfect edge. One has been
sharpened and the other not. And I am very sure that
the men who write best do not necessarily know the
most; Fate has put an edge on them&mdash;that's all. A
good kick may start a stone rolling, when otherwise
it rests on the mountain-side for a generation.</p>

<p>Kenyon was one type of the men who rest on the
mountain-side. He dabbled in poetry, wrote book-reviews,
collected rare editions, attended first nights,
spoke mysteriously of &quot;stuff&quot; he was working on;
and sometimes confidentially told his lady friends of
his intention to bring it out when he had gotten it
into shape, asking their advice as to bindings, etc.
Men of this type rarely bring out their stuff, for the
reason that they never get it into shape. When they
refer to the novel they have on the stocks, they refer
to a novel they intend to write. It is yet in the ink-bottle.
And there it remains&mdash;all for the want of one
good kick&mdash;but perhaps it's just as well.</p>

<p>Yet these friendly beings are very useful members of
society. They are brighter companions and better
<a name="II_Page_24"></a>talkers than the men who exhaust themselves in creative
work and at odd times favor their friends with
choice samples of literary irritability. John Kenyon
wrote a few bright little things, but his best work was
in the encouragement he gave others. He sought out
all literary lions and tamed them with his steady
glance. They liked his prattle and good-cheer, and he
liked them for many reasons&mdash;one of which was because
he could go away and tell how he advised them about
this, that and the other. Then he fed them, too.</p>

<p>And so unrivaled was Kenyon in this line that he won
for himself the title of &quot;The Feeder of Lions.&quot; Now,
John Kenyon&mdash;rich, idle, bookish and generous&mdash;saw
in the magazines certain fine little poems by one
Elizabeth Barrett. He also ascertained that she had
published several books. Mr. Kenyon bought one of
these volumes and sent it by a messenger with a little
note to Miss Barrett telling how much he had enjoyed
it, and craved that she would inscribe her name and
his on the fly-leaf and return by bearer. Of course she
complied with such a modest request so gracefully
expressed; these things are balm to poets' souls. Next,
Mr. Kenyon called to thank Miss Barrett for the autograph.
Soon after, he wrote to inform her of a startling
fact that he had just discovered: they were kinsmen,
cousins or something&mdash;a little removed, but cousins
still. In a few weeks they wrote letters back and forth
beginning thus: Dear Cousin.</p>

<p><a name="II_Page_25"></a>And I am glad of this cousinly arrangement between
lonely young people. They grasp at it; and it gives an
excuse for a bit of closer relationship than could otherwise
exist with propriety. Goodness me! is he not my
cousin? Of course he may call as often as he chooses.
It is his right.</p>

<p>But let me explain here that at this time Mr. Kenyon
was not so very young&mdash;that is, he was not absurdly
young: he was fifty. But men who really love books
always have young hearts. Kenyon's father left him
a fortune, no troubles had ever come his way, and his
was not the temperament that searches them out.
He dressed young, looked young, acted young, felt
young.</p>

<p>No doubt John Kenyon sincerely admired Elizabeth
Barrett, and prized her work. And while she read his
mind a deal more understandingly than he did her
poems, she was grateful for his kindly attention and
well-meant praise. He set about to get her poems into
better magazines and to find better publishers for her
work. He was not a gifted poet himself, but to dance
attendance on one afforded a gratification to his artistic
impulse. He could not write sublime verse himself,
but he could tell others how. So Miss Barrett showed
her poems to Mr. Kenyon, and Mr. Kenyon advised
that the P's be made bolder and the tails to the Q's be
lengthened. He also bought her a new kind of manuscript
paper, over which a quill pen would glide with glee:
<a name="II_Page_26"></a>it was the kind Byron used. But best of all, Mr. Kenyon
brought his friends to call on Miss Barrett; and many
of these friends were men with good literary instincts.
The meeting with these strong minds was no doubt a
great help to the little lady, shut up in a big house
and living largely in dreams.</p>

<p>Mary Russell Mitford was in London about this time
on a little visit, and of course was sought out by John
Kenyon, who took her sightseeing. She was fifty years
old, too; she spoke of herself as an old maid, but didn't
allow others to do so. Friends always spoke of her as
&quot;Little Miss Mitford,&quot; not because she was little,
but because she acted so. Among other beautiful
sights that Mr. Kenyon wished to show gushing little
Mary Mitford was a Miss Barrett who wrote things.
So together they called on Miss Barrett.</p>

<p>Little Miss Mitford looked at the pale face in its
frame of dark curls, lying back among the pillows.
Little Miss Mitford bowed and said it was a fine day;
then she went right over and kissed Miss Barrett, and
these two women held each other's hands and talked
until Mr. Kenyon twisted nervously and hinted that
it was time to go.</p>

<p>Miss Barrett had not been out for two months, but
now these two insisted that she should go with them.
The carriage was at the door, they would support her
very tenderly, Mr. Kenyon himself would drive&mdash;so
there could be no accidents and they would bring her
<a name="II_Page_27"></a>back the moment she was tired. So they went, did
these three, and as Mr. Kenyon himself drove there
were no accidents.</p>

<p>I can imagine that James the coachman gave up the
reins that day with only an inward protest, and after
looking down and smiling reassurance Mr. Kenyon
drove slowly towards the Park; little Miss Mitford
forgot her promise not to talk incessantly; and the
&quot;dainty, white-porcelain lady&quot; brushed back the
raven curls from time to time and nodded indulgently.</p>

<p>Not long ago I called at Number Seventy-four
Gloucester Place, where the Barretts lived. It is a
plain, solid brick house, built just like the ten thousand
other brick houses in London where well-to-do
tradesmen live. The people who now occupy the house
never heard of the Barretts, and surely do not belong
to a Browning Club. I was told that if I wanted to
know anything about the place I should apply to the
&quot;Agent,&quot; whose name is 'Opkins and whose office is in
Clifford Court, off Fleet Street. The house probably
has not changed in any degree in these fifty years,
since little Miss Mitford on one side and Mr. Kenyon
on the other, tenderly helped Miss Barrett down the
steps and into the carriage.</p>

<p>I lingered about Gloucester Place for an hour, but
finding that I was being furtively shadowed by various
servants, and discovering further that a policeman had
been summoned to look after my case, I moved on.</p>
<p><a name="II_Page_28"></a></p>
<p>That night after the ride, Miss Mitford wrote a
letter home and among other things she said: &quot;I called
today at a Mr. Barrett's. The eldest daughter is about
twenty-five. She has some spinal affection, but she is
a charming, sweet young woman who reads Greek as I
do French. She has published some translations from
&AElig;schylus and some striking poems. She is a delightful
creature, shy, timid and modest.&quot;</p>

<p>The next day Mr. Kenyon gave a little dinner in honor
of Miss Mitford, who was the author of a great book
called, &quot;Our Village.&quot; That night when Miss Mitford
wrote her usual letter to the folks down in the country,
telling how she was getting along, she described this
dinner-party. She says: &quot;Wordsworth was there&mdash;an
adorable old man. Then there was Walter Savage
Landor, too, as splendid a person as Mr. Kenyon himself,
but not so full of sweetness and sympathy. But best
of all, the charming Miss Barrett, who translated the
most difficult of the Greek plays, 'Prometheus Bound.'
She has written most exquisite poems, too, in almost
every modern style. She is so sweet and gentle, and
so pretty that one looks at her as if she were some
bright flower.&quot; Then in another letter Miss Mitford
adds: &quot;She is of a slight, delicate figure, with a shower
of dark curls falling on either side of a most expressive
face; large tender eyes, richly fringed by dark lashes; a
smile like a sunbeam, and such a look of youthfulness
that I had some difficulty in persuading a friend that
<a name="II_Page_29"></a>she was really the translator of &AElig;schylus and the
author of the 'Essay on Mind.'&quot;</p>

<p>When Miss Mitford went back home, she wrote Miss
Barrett a letter 'most every day. She addresses her as
&quot;My Sweet Love,&quot; &quot;My Dearest Sweet,&quot; and &quot;My
Sweetest Dear.&quot; She declares her to be the gentlest,
strongest, sanest, noblest and most spiritual of all
living persons. And moreover she wrote these things
to others and published them in reviews. She gave
Elizabeth Barrett much good advice and some not so
good. Among other things she says: &quot;Your one fault,
my dear, is obscurity. You must be simple and plain.
Think of the stupidest person of your acquaintance,
and when you have made your words so clear that
you are sure he will understand, you may venture to
hope it will be understood by others.&quot;</p>

<p>I hardly think that this advice caused Miss Barrett to
bring her lines down to the level of the stupidest person
she knew. She continued to write just as she chose. Yet
she was grateful for Miss Mitford's glowing friendship,
and all the pretty gush was accepted, although perhaps
with good large pinches of the Syracuse product.</p>

<p>Of course there are foolish people who assume that
gushing women are shallow, but this is jumping at
conclusions. A recent novel gives us a picture of &quot;a
tall soldier,&quot; who, in camp, was very full of brag and
bluster. We are quite sure that when the fight comes
on this man with the lubricated tongue will prove an
<a name="II_Page_30"></a>arrant coward; we assume that he will run at the first
smell of smoke. But we are wrong&mdash;he stuck; and
when the flag was carried down in the rush, he rescued
it and bore it bravely so far to the front that when he
came back he brought another&mdash;the tawdry, red flag
of the enemy!</p>

<p>I slip this in here just to warn hasty folk against the
assumption that talkative people are necessarily vacant-minded.
Man has a many-sided nature, and like the
moon reveals only certain phases at certain times.
And as there is one side of the moon that is never
revealed at all to dwellers on the planet Earth, so
mortals may unconsciously conceal certain phases of
soul-stuff from each other.</p>

<p>Miss Barrett seems to have written more letters and
longer ones to Miss Mitford than to any of her other
correspondents, save one. Yet she was aware of this
rather indiscreet woman's limitations and wrote down
to her understanding.</p>

<p>To Richard H. Horne she wrote freely and at her
intellectual best. With this all-round, gifted man she
kept up a correspondence for many years; and her
letters now published in two stout volumes afford a
literary history of the time. At the risk of being accused
of lack of taste, I wish to say that these letters of
Miss Barrett's are a deal more interesting to me than
any of her longer poems. They reveal the many-sided
qualities of the writer, and show the workings of her
<a name="II_Page_31"></a>mind in various moods. Poetry is such an exacting
form that it never allows the author to appear in dressing-gown
and slippers; neither can he call over the
back fence to his neighbor without loss of dignity.</p>

<p>Horne was author, editor and publisher. His middle
name was Henry, but following that peculiar penchant
of the ink-stained fraternity to play flimflam with
their names, he changed the Henry to Hengist; so we
now see it writ thus: R. Hengist Horne.</p>

<p>He found a market for Miss Barrett's wares. More
properly, he insisted that she should write certain things
to fit certain publications in which he was interested.
They collaborated in writing several books. They met
very seldom, and their correspondence has a fine friendly
flavor about it, tempered with a disinterestedness that is
unique. They encourage each other, criticize each other.
They rail at each other in witty quips and quirks, and at
times the air is so full of gibes that it looks as if a quarrel
were appearing on the horizon&mdash;no bigger than a man's
hand&mdash;but the storm always passes in a gentle shower of
refreshing compliments.</p>

<p>Meantime, dodging in and out, we see the handsome,
gracious and kindly John Kenyon.</p>

<p>Much of the time Miss Barrett lived in a darkened
room, seeing no one but her nurse, the physician and her
father. Fortune had smiled again on Edward Barrett&mdash;a
legacy had come his way, and although he no longer
owned the black men in Jamaica, yet they were again
<a name="II_Page_32"></a>working for him. Sugar-cane mills ground slow, but
small.</p>

<p>The brilliant daughter had blossomed in intellect until
she was beyond her teacher. She was so far ahead that
he called to her to wait for him. He could read Greek;
she could compose in it. But she preferred her native
tongue, as every scholar should. Now, Mr. Barrett was
jealous of the fame of his daughter. The passion of
father for daughter, of mother for son&mdash;there is often
something very loverlike in it&mdash;a deal of whimsy! Miss
Barrett's darkened room had been illumined by a light
that the gruff and goodly merchant wist not of. Loneliness
and solitude and physical pain and heart-hunger
had taught her things that no book recorded nor tutor
knew. Her father could not follow her; her allusions
were obscure, he said, wilfully obscure; she was growing
perverse.</p>

<p>Love is a pain at times. To ease the hurt the lover would
hurt the beloved. He badgers her, pinches her, provokes
her. One step more and he may kill her.</p>

<p>Edward Barrett's daughter, she of the raven curls and
gentle ways, was reaching a point where her father's
love was not her life. A good way to drive love away is
to be jealous. He had seen it coming years before; he
brooded over it; the calamity was upon him. Her fame
was growing: some one called her the Shakespeare of
women. First, her books had been published at her
father's expense; next, editors were willing to run their
<a name="II_Page_33"></a>own risks, and now messengers with bank-notes waited
at the door and begged to exchange the bank-notes for
manuscript. John Kenyon said, &quot;I told you so,&quot; but
Edward Barrett scowled. He accused her foolishly; he
attempted to dictate to her&mdash;she must use this ink or
that. Why? Because he said so. He quarreled with her
to ease the love-hurt that was smarting in his heart.</p>

<p>Poor, little, pale-faced poet! Earthly success has nothing
left for thee! Thy thoughts, too great for speech, fall on
dull ears. Even thy father, for whom thou first took up
pen, doth not understand thee! and a mother's love
thou hast never known. And fame without love&mdash;how
barren! Heaven is thy home. Let slip thy thin, white
hands on the thread of life and glide gently out at ebb
of tide&mdash;out into the unknown. It can not but be better
than this&mdash;God understands! Compose thy troubled
spirit, give up thy vain hopes. See! thy youth is past,
little woman; look closely! there are gray hairs in thy
locks, thy face is marked with lines of care, and have I
not seen signs of winter in thy veins? Earth holds
naught for thee. Come, take thy pen and write, just a
last good-by, a tender farewell, such as thou alone canst
say. Then fold thy thin hands, and make peace with all
by passing out and away, out and away&mdash;God understands!</p>
<p><a name="II_Page_34"></a></p>
<hr />

<p>Elizabeth Barrett was thirty-seven,
and Miss Mitford, up to London from the
country for a couple of days, wrote home that
she had lost her winsome beauty.</p>

<p>John Kenyon had turned well into sixty, but he carried
his years in a jaunty way. He wore a moss-rose bud in
the lapel of his well-fitting coat. His linen was immaculate,
and the only change people saw in him was that he
wore spectacles in place of a monocle.</p>

<p>The physicians allowed Mr. Kenyon to visit the darkened
room whenever he chose, for he never stayed so
very long, neither was he ever the bearer of bad news.</p>

<p>Did the greatest poetess of the age (temporarily slightly
indisposed) know one Browning&mdash;Robert Browning, a
writer of verse? Why, no; she had never met him, but of
course she knew of him, and had read everything he had
written. He had sent her one of his books once. He was
surely a man of brilliant parts&mdash;so strong and farseeing!
He lives in Italy, with the monks, they say. What a
pity the English people do not better appreciate him!</p>

<p>&quot;But he may succeed yet,&quot; said Mr. Kenyon. &quot;He is
not old.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, of course, such genius must some day be recognized.
But he may be gone then&mdash;how old did you say
he was?&quot;</p>

<p>Mr. Kenyon had not said; but he now explained that
Mr. Browning was thirty-four, that is to say, just the
age of himself, ahem! Furthermore, Mr. Browning did
<a name="II_Page_35"></a>not live in Italy&mdash;that is, not now, for at that present
moment he was in London. In fact, Mr. Kenyon had
lunched with him an hour before. They had talked of
Miss Barrett (for who else was there among women
worth talking of!) and Mr. Browning had expressed a
wish to see her. Mr. Kenyon had expressed a wish that
Mr. Browning should see her, and now if Miss Barrett
would express a wish that Mr. Browning should call
and see her, why, Mr. Kenyon would fetch him&mdash;doctors
or no doctors.</p>

<p>And he fetched him.</p>

<p>And I'm glad, aren't you?</p>

<p>Now Robert Browning was not at all of the typical poet
type. In stature, he was rather short; his frame was
compact and muscular. In his youth, he had been a
wrestler&mdash;carrying away laurels of a different sort from
those which he was to wear later. His features were
inclined to be heavy; in repose his face was dull, and
there was no fire in his glance. He wore loose-fitting,
plain, gray clothes, a slouch-hat and thick-soled shoes.
At first look you would have said he was a well-fed,
well-to-do country squire. On closer acquaintance you
would have been impressed with his dignity, his perfect
poise and his fine reserve. And did you come to know
him well enough you would have seen that beneath that
seemingly phlegmatic outside there was a spiritual
nature so sensitive and tender that it responded to all
the finer thrills that play across the souls of men. Yet if
<a name="II_Page_36"></a>there ever was a man who did not wear his heart upon
his sleeve for daws to peck at, it was Robert Browning.
He was clean, wholesome, manly, healthy, inside and
out. He was master of self.</p>

<p>Of course, the gentle reader is sure that the next act
will show a tender love-scene. And were I dealing with
the lives of Peter Smith and Martha the milkmaid, the
gentle reader might be right.</p>

<p>But the love of Robert Browning and Elizabeth Barrett
is an instance of the Divine Passion. Take off thy shoes,
for the place whereon thou standest is holy ground! This
man and woman had gotten well beyond the first flush
of youth; there was a joining of intellect and soul which
approaches the ideal. I can not imagine anything so
preposterous as a &quot;proposal&quot; passing between them;
I can not conceive a condition of hesitancy and timidity
leading up to a dam-bursting &quot;avowal.&quot; They met,
looked into each other's eyes, and each there read his
fate: no coyness, no affectation, no fencing&mdash;they loved.
Each at once felt a heart-rest in the other. Each had at
last found the other self.</p>

<p>That exquisite series of poems, &quot;Sonnets From the
Portuguese,&quot; written by Elizabeth Barrett before her
marriage and presented to her husband afterward, was
all told to him over and over by the look from her eyes,
the pressure of her hands, and in gentle words (or
silence) that knew neither shame nor embarrassment.</p>

<p>And now it seems to me that somewhere in these pages I
<a name="II_Page_37"></a>said that friendship was essentially hygienic. I wish to
make that remark again, and to put it in italics. The
Divine Passion implies the most exalted form of friendship
that man can imagine.</p>

<p>Elizabeth Barrett ran up the shades and flung open the
shutters. The sunlight came dancing through the apartment,
flooding each dark corner and driving out all the
shadows that lurked therein. It was no longer a darkened
room.</p>

<p>The doctor was indignant; the nurse resigned.</p>

<p>Miss Mitford wrote back to the country that Miss
Barrett was &quot;really looking better than she had for
years.&quot;</p>

<p>As for poor Edward Moulton Barrett&mdash;he raved. He
tried to quarrel with Robert Browning, and had there
been only a callow youth with whom to deal, Browning
would simply have been kicked down the steps, and that
would have been an end of it. But Browning had an
even pulse, a calm eye and a temper that was imperturbable.
His will was quite as strong as Mr. Barrett's.</p>

<p>And so it was just a plain runaway match&mdash;the ideal
thing after all. One day when the father was out of the
way they took a cab to Marylebone Parish Church
and were married. The bride went home alone, and it
was a week before her husband saw her; because he
would not be a hypocrite and go ask for her by her
maiden name. And had he gone, rung the bell and
asked to see Elizabeth Barrett Browning, no one would
<a name="II_Page_38"></a>have known whom he wanted. At the end of the week,
the bride stole down the steps alone, leading her dog
Flush by a string, and met her lover-husband on the
corner. Next day, they wrote back from Calais, asking
forgiveness and craving blessings, after the good old
custom of Gretna Green. But Edward Moulton Barrett
did not forgive&mdash;still, who cares!</p>

<p>Yet we do care, too, for we regret that this man, so
strong and manly in many ways, could not be reconciled
to this exalted love. Old men who nurse wrath are
pitiable sights. Why could not Mr. Barrett have followed
the example of John Kenyon?</p>

<p>Kenyon commands both our sympathy and admiration.
When the news came to him that Robert Browning and
Elizabeth Barrett were gone, it is said that he sobbed
like a youth to whom has come a great, strange sorrow.
For months he was not known to smile, yet after a year
he visited the happy home in Florence. When John
Kenyon died he left by his will fifty thousand dollars
&quot;to my beloved and loving friends, Robert Browning
and Elizabeth Barrett, his wife.&quot;</p>

<p>The old-time novelists always left their couples at the
church-door. It was not safe to follow further&mdash;they
wished to make a pleasant story. It seems meet to take
our leave of the bride and groom at the church: life
often ends there. However, it sometimes is the place
where life really begins. It was so with Elizabeth Barrett
and Robert Browning&mdash;they had merely existed before;
<a name="II_Page_39"></a>now, they began to live.</p>

<p>Much, very much has been
written concerning this ideal mating, and of the life of
Mr. and Mrs. Browning in Italy. But why should I
write of the things of which George William Curtis,
Kate Field, Anthony Trollope and James T. Fields have
written? No, we will leave the happy pair at the altar,
in Marylebone Parish Church, and while the organ peals
the wedding-march we will tiptoe softly out.

<p><br /><a name="II_Page_44"></a><a name="II_Page_45"></a></p>
<p>Jeanne Marie Bouvier sat one
day writing at her little oaken desk,
when her father approached and,
kissing her very gently on the forehead,
told her that he had arranged
for her marriage, and that her future
husband was soon to arrive. Jeanne's
fingers lost their cunning, the pen
dropped; she arose to her feet, but her tongue was dumb.</p>

<p>Jeanne Marie was only sixteen, but you would have
thought her twenty, for she was tall and dignified&mdash;she
was as tall as her father: she was five feet nine. She had
a splendid length of limb, hips that gave only a suggestion
of curve line, a slender waist, a shapely, well-poised
neck, and a head that might have made a Juno
envious. The face and brow were not those of Venus&mdash;rather
they belonged to Minerva; for the nose was large,
the chin full, and the mouth no pea's blossom. The hair
was light brown, but when the sun shone on it people
said it was red. It was as generous in quantity and
unruly in habits as the westerly wind. Her eyes were all
colors, changing according to her mood. Withal, she
had freckles, and no one was ever so rash as to call her
pretty.</p>

<p>Now, Jeanne's father had not kissed her for two years,
for he was a very busy man: he had not time for soft
<a name="II_Page_46"></a>demonstration. He was rich, he was religious, and he
was looked upon as a model citizen in every way.</p>

<p>The daughter had grown like a sunflower, and her
intellect had unfolded as a moss-rose turns from bud to
blossom. This splendid girl had thought and studied and
dreamed dreams. She had imagined she heard a voice
speaking to her: &quot;Arise, maiden, and prepare thee, for
I have a work for thee to do!&quot;</p>

<p>Her wish and prayer was to enter a convent, and after
consecrating herself to God in a way that would allow of
no turning back, to go forth and give to men and
women the messages that had come to her. And these
things filled the heart of the worthy bourgeois with
alarm; so he said to his wife one day: &quot;That girl will be
a foot taller than I am in a year, and even now when I
give her advice, she opens her big eyes and looks at me
in a way that thins my words to whey. She will get us
into trouble yet! She may disgrace us! I think&mdash;I think
I'll find her a husband.&quot;</p>

<p>Yet that would not have been a difficult task. She was
loved by a score of youths, but had never spoken to any
of them. They stood at corners and sighed as she walked
by; and others, with religious bent, timed her hours for
mass and took positions in church from whence they
could see her kneel. Still others patroled the narrow
street that led to her home, with hopes that she might
pass that way, so that they might touch the hem of her
garment.</p>
<p><a name="II_Page_47"></a></p>
<p>These things were as naught to Jeanne Marie. She had
never yet seen a man for whose intellect she did not
have both a pity and a contempt.</p>

<p>But Claude Bouvier did not pick a husband for his
daughter from among the simple youths of the town.
He wrote to a bachelor friend, Jacques Guyon by name,
and told him he could have the girl if he wanted her&mdash;that
is, after certain little preliminaries had been
arranged.</p>

<p>Now, Jacques Guyon had been at the Bouvier residence
on a visit three months before, and had looked the lass
over stealthily with peculiar interest, and had intimated
that if Monsieur Bouvier wished to get rid of her it
could be brought about. So, after some weeks had passed,
Monsieur bethought him of the offer of Jacques Guyon,
and he concluded that inasmuch as Guyon was rich and
respectable it would be a good match.</p>

<p>So he wrote to Guyon, and Guyon replied that he would
come, probably within a fortnight&mdash;just as soon as his
rheumatism got better.</p>

<p>Monsieur Claude Bouvier read the letter, and walking
into the next room, surprised Jeanne Marie by kissing
her tenderly on her forehead&mdash;all as herein truthfully
recorded.</p>
<p><a name="II_Page_48"></a></p>
<hr />

<p>So Jacques Guyon came, came in his carriage,
with two servants riding on horseback in
front and another riding on horseback behind.
Jeanne Marie sat on the floor, tailor fashion,
up in her little room of the old stone house, and peeked
out of the diamond-paned gable-window very cautiously;
and she was sorely disappointed.</p>

<p>In some of her dreams (and these dreams she thought
were very bad), she had pictured a lover coming alone
on a foam-flecked charger; and as the steed paused, the
rider leaped lightly from saddle to ground, kissing his
hand to her as she peeked through the curtains. For he
discovered her when she hoped he would not, but she
did not care much if he did.</p>

<p>But Monsieur Guyon's eyes did not search the windows.
He got out of the carriage with difficulty, and his breath
came wheezy and short as he mounted the steps. His
complexion was dusty blue, his nose tinged with carmine,
his eyes watery, and his girth aldermanic. He was
growing old, and, saddest of all, he was growing old
rebelliously and therefore ungracefully&mdash;dyeing his
whiskers purple.</p>

<p>That evening when Jeanne Marie was introduced to
Monsieur Guyon at dinner she found him very polite
and very gracious. His breeches were real black velvet
and his stockings were silk, and the buckles on his shoes
were polished silver and the frill of his shirt was finest
lace. His conversation was directed mostly to Jeanne's
<a name="II_Page_49"></a>father, so Jeanne did not feel nearly so uncomfortable
as she had expected.</p>

<p>The next day a notary came, and long papers were
written out, and red and green seals placed on them,
and then everybody held up his right hand as the notary
mumbled something, and then all signed their names.
The room seemed to be teetering up and down, and it
looked quite like rain. Monsieur Bouvier stood on his
tiptoes and again kissed his daughter on the forehead,
and Monsieur Guyon, taking her hand, lifted the long,
slender fingers to his lips, and told her that she would
soon be a great lady and the mistress of a splendid
mansion, and have everything that one needed to make
one happy.</p>

<p>And so they were married by a bishop, with two priests
and three curates to assist. The ceremony was held at
the great stone church; and as the procession came out,
the verger had a hard time to keep the crowd back, so
that the little girls in white could go before and strew
flowers in their pathway. The organ pealed, and the
chimes clanged and rang as if the tune and the times
were out of joint; then other bells from other parts of
the old town answered, and across the valley rang
mellow and soft the chapel-bell of Montargis Castle.</p>

<p>Jeanne was seated in a carriage&mdash;how she got there she
never knew; by her side sat Jacques Guyon. The post-boys
were lashing their horses into a savage run, like
devils running away with the souls of innocents, and
<a name="II_Page_50"></a>behind clattered the mounted, liveried servant. People
on the sidewalks waved good-bys and called God-bless-yous.
Soon the sleepy old town was left behind and the
horses slowed down to a lazy trot. Jeanne looked back,
like Lot's wife: only a church-spire could be seen. She
hoped that she might be turned into a pillar of salt&mdash;but
she wasn't. She crouched into the corner of the seat
and cried a good honest cry.</p>

<p>And Monsieur Jacques Guyon smiled and muttered to
himself, &quot;Her father said she was a bit stubborn, but
I'll see that she gets over it!&quot;</p>

<p>And this was over three hundred years ago. It doesn't
seem like it, but it was.</p>

<p>Read the lives of great men and you will come
to the conclusion that it is harder to find a
gentleman than a genius. While the clock
ticks off the seconds, count on your fingers&mdash;within
five minutes, if you can&mdash;five such gentlemen as
Sir Philip Sidney! Of course, I know before you speak
that Fenelon will be the first on your tongue. Fenelon,
the low-voiced, the mild, the sympathetic, the courtly,
the gracious! Fenelon, favored by the gods with beauty
and far-reaching intellect! Fenelon, who knew the gold
of silence. Fenelon, on whose lips dwelt grace, and who
by the magic of his words had but to speak to be
believed and to be beloved.</p>

<p>When Louis the Little made that most audacious
blunder which cost France millions in treasure and
untold loss in men and women, Fenelon wrote to the
Prime Minister: &quot;These Huguenots have many virtues
that must be acknowledged and conserved. We must
hold them by mildness. We can not produce conformity
by force. Converts made in this manner are hypocrites.
No power is great enough to bind the mind&mdash;thought
forever escapes. Give civil liberty to all, not by approving
all religions, but by permitting in patience what God
allows.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You shall go as missionary to these renegades!&quot; was
the answer&mdash;half-ironical, half-earnest.</p>

<p>&quot;I will go only on one condition.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And that is?&quot;</p>
<p><a name="II_Page_52"></a></p>
<p>&quot;That from my province you withdraw all armed
men&mdash;all sign of compulsion of every sort!&quot;</p>

<p>Fenelon was of noble blood, but his sympathies were
ever with the people. The lowly, the weak, the oppressed,
the persecuted&mdash;these were ever the objects of his
solicitude&mdash;these were first in his mind.</p>

<p>It was in prison that Fenelon first met Madame Guyon.
Fenelon was thirty-seven, she was forty. He occasionally
preached at Montargis, and while there had heard of
her goodness, her piety, her fervor, her resignation. He
had small sympathy for many of her peculiar views,
but now she was sick and in prison and he went to her
and admonished her to hold fast and to be of good-cheer.</p>

<p>Twelve years before this Madame Guyon had been
left a widow. She was the mother of five children&mdash;two
were dead. The others were placed under the care of
kind kinsmen; and Madame Guyon went forth to give
her days to study and to teaching. This action of placing
her children partly in the care of others has been harshly
criticized. But there is one phase of the subject that I
have never seen commented upon&mdash;and that is that a
mother's love for her offspring bears a certain ratio to
the love she bore their father. Had Madame Guyon ever
carried in her arms a love-child, I can not conceive of
her allowing this child to be cared for by others&mdash;no
matter how competent.</p>

<p>The favor that had greeted Madame Guyon wherever
she went was very great. Her animation and devout
<a name="II_Page_53"></a>enthusiasm won her entrance into the homes of the
great and noble everywhere. She organized societies of
women that met for prayer and conversation on exalted
themes. The burden of her philosophy was &quot;Quietism&quot;&mdash;the
absolute submission of the human soul to the will
of God. Give up all, lay aside all striving, all reaching
out, all unrest, cease penance and lie low in the Lord's
hand. He doeth all things well. Make life one continual
prayer for holiness&mdash;wholeness&mdash;harmony; and thus all
good will come to us&mdash;we attract the good; we attract
God&mdash;He is our friend&mdash;His spirit dwells with us. She
taught of power through repose, and told that you can
never gain peace by striving for it like fury.</p>

<p>This philosophy, stretching out in limitless ramifications,
bearing on every phase and condition of life,
touched everywhere with mysticism, afforded endless
opportunity for thought.</p>

<p>It is the same philosophy that is being expressed by
thousands of prominent men and women today. It
embraced all that is vital and best in our so-called
&quot;advanced thought&quot;; for in good sooth none of our
new &quot;liberal sects&quot; has anything that has not been
taught before in olden time.</p>

<p>But Madame Guyon's success was too great. The
guardians of a dogmatic religion are ever on the scent
for heresy. They are jealous, and fearful, and full of
alarm lest their &quot;institution&quot; shall topple. Quietism
was making head, and throughout France the name of
<a name="II_Page_54"></a>Madame Guyon was becoming known. She went from
town to town, and from city to city, and gave courses
of lectures. Women flocked to hear her, they organized
clubs. Preachers sometimes appeared and argued with
her, but by the high fervor of her speech she quickly
silenced them. Then they took revenge by thundering
sermons against her after she had gone. As she traveled
she left in her wake a pyrotechnic display of elocutionary
denunciation. They dared her to come back and
fight it out. The air was full of challenges. One prelate
was good enough to say, &quot;This woman may teach
primitive Christianity&mdash;but if people find God everywhere,
what's to become of us!&quot;</p>

<p>And although the theme is as great as Fate and as
serious as Death, one can not suppress a smile to think
how the fear of losing their jobs has ever caused men to
run violently to and fro and up and down in the earth,
crying peace, peace, when there is no peace.</p>

<p>Now, it was the denunciation and wild demonstration
of her fearing foes that advertised the labors of Madame
Guyon. For strong people are not so much advertised
by their loving friends as by their rabid enemies.</p>

<p>This happened quite a while ago; but as mankind moves
in a circle (and not always a spiral, either) it might have
happened yesterday. Make the scene Ohio: slip Bossuet
out and Doctor Buckley in; condense the virtues of Miss
Frances E. Willard and Miss Susan B. Anthony into
one, and let this one stand for Madame Guyon; call it
<a name="II_Page_55"></a>New Transcendentalism, dub the Madame a New
Woman, and there you have it!</p>

<p>But with this difference: petitions to the President of
the United States to arrest this female offender and
shut her up in the Chicago jail, indefinitely, after a mock
trial, would avail not. Yet persecution has its compensation,
and the treatment that Madame Guyon received
emphasized the truths she taught and sent them ringing
through the schools and salons and wherever thinking
people gathered themselves together. Yes, persecution
has its compensation. In its state of persecution a religion
is pure, if ever; its decline begins when its prosperity
commences. Prosperous men are never wise and seldom
good. Woe unto you when all men shall speak well of you!</p>

<p>Surely, persecution has its compensation! When
Madame Guyon was sick and in prison, was she not
visited by Fenelon? Ah, 'twas worth the cost. Sympathy
is the first attribute of love as well as its last.
And I am not sure but that sympathy is love's own
self, vitalized mayhap by some divine actinic ray. Only
a thorn-crowned, bleeding Christ could win the adoration
of the world. Only the souls who have suffered are
well loved. Thus does Golgotha find its recompense.
Hark ye and take courage, ye who are in bonds! Gracious
spirits, seen or unseen, will minister to you now,
where otherwise they would have passed without a sign!
But from the day Fenelon met Madame Guyon his
fortune began to decline. People looked at him askance.
<a name="II_Page_56"></a>By a grim chance he was made one of a committee of
three to investigate the charges brought against the
woman. The court took a year for its task. Fenelon
read everything that Madame Guyon had published,
conversed much with her, inquired into her history and
when asked for his verdict said, &quot;I find no fault in her.&quot;</p>

<p>He talked with Madame de Maintenon, and Madame
de Maintenon talked with the King, and the offender
was released.</p>

<p>Soon Fenelon began to utter in his sermons the truths
he had learned from Madame Guyon. And he gave her
due credit. He explained that she was a good Catholic&mdash;that
she loved the Church&mdash;that she lived up to all the
Church taught, and besides knowing all that Churchmen
knew she knew many things beside.</p>

<p>Have a care, Archbishop of Cambrai! Enemies are upon
thy track. Defend not defenseless womanhood: knowest
thou not what they have said of her? Speak what thou
art taught and keep thy inmost thoughts for thyself
alone. Have a care, Fenelon! thy bishopric hangs by a
spider's thread.</p>

<p>The years kept slipping past as the years will. Twelve
summers had come, and twelve times had autumn
leaves known their time to fall. Madame Guyon was
again in prison. A stranger was Archbishop of Cambrai:
Fenelon no longer a counselor of kings&mdash;a tutor of
royalty. His voice was silenced, his pen chained. He was
allowed to retire to a rural parish. There he lived with
<a name="II_Page_57"></a>the peasants&mdash;revered, beloved. The country where he
dwelt was battle-scarred and bleeding; the smoke of
devastation still hung over it. Not a family but had
been robbed of its best. Death had stalked rampant.
Fenelon shared the poverty of the people, their lowliness,
their sorrows. All the tragedy of their life was his;
he said to them, &quot;I know, I know!&quot;</p>

<p>Twelve years of Madame Guyon's life were spent in
prison. Toward the last she was allowed to live in
nominal freedom. But despotism, with savage leer and
stealthy step, saw that Fenelon was kept far away. In
those declining days, when the shadows were lengthening
toward the east, her time and talents were given to
teaching the simple rudiments of knowledge to the
peasantry, to alleviating their material wants and to
ministering to the sick. It was a forced retirement, and
yet it was a retirement that was in every way in accord
with her desires. But in spite of the persecution that
followed her, and the obloquy heaped upon her name,
and the bribe of pardon if she would but recant, she
never retracted nor wavered in her inward or outward
faith, even in the estimation of a hair. The firm reticence
as to the supreme secrets of her life, and her steadfast
loyalty to that which she honestly believed was truth,
must ever command the affectionate admiration of all
those who prize integrity of mind and purity of purpose,
who hold fast to the divinity of love, and who believe
in the things unseen which are eternal.</p>
<p><a name="II_Page_58"></a></p>
<hr />

<p>The town of Montargis is one day's bicycle
journey from Paris. As for the road, though
one be a wayfaring man and from the States
he could not err therein. You simply follow
the Seine as if you were intent on discovering its source,
keeping to the beautiful highway that follows the
winding stream. And what a beautiful, clear, clean bit
of water it is! In Paris, your washerwoman takes your
linen to the river, just as they did in the days of Pharaoh,
and the bundle comes back sweet as the breath of June.
Imagine the result of such recklessness in Chicago!</p>

<p>But as I rode out of Paris that bright May day it
seemed Monday all along the way; for dames with
baskets balanced on their heads were making their way
to the waterside, followed by troops of barefoot or
sabot-shod children. There was one fine young woman
with a baby in her arms, and the innocent firstborn was
busily taking its breakfast as the mother walked calmly
along, bearing on her well-poised head the family wash.
And a mile farther on, as if she had seen her rival and
gone her one better, was another woman with a two-year-old
cherub perched secure on top of the gently
swaying basket, proud as a cardinal about to be consecrated.
It was a study in balancing that I have never
seen before nor since; and I only ask those to believe it
who know things so true that they dare not tell them.
As the day wore on, I saw that the wash was being
completed, for the garments were spread out on the
<a name="II_Page_59"></a>greenest of green grass, or on the bushes that lined the
way. By ten o'clock I was nearing Fontainebleau, and
the clothes were nearly ready to take in&mdash;but not quite.
For while waiting for the warm sun and the gentle
breeze to dry them, the thrifty dames, who were
French and make soup out of everything, put in the
time by laundering the children. It seemed like that
economic stroke of good housewives who use the soapy
wash-water for scrubbing the kitchen-floor. There they
were, dozens of hopefuls on whom the fate of the nation
rested&mdash;creepers to ten-year-olds&mdash;being scrubbed and
dipped, or playing parlez-vous tag in lieu of towel, as
innocent of clothes as Carlyle's imaginary House of
Lords.</p>

<p>And so I passed off from the road that traced the Seine
to a road that kept company with the canal. I followed
the towpath, even in spite of warnings that 't was
'gainst the law. It was a one-horse canal, for many of
the gaily painted boats were drawn only by a single,
shaggy-limbed Percheron. The boats were sharp-prowed
and narrow; and on some were bareheaded
women knitting, and men carving curious things out of
blocks of wood, as they journeyed. And I said to myself,
if &quot;it is the pace that kills,&quot; these people are making a
strong bid for immortality. I hailed the lazily moving
craft, waving my hat, and the slow-going tourists called
back cheerily.</p>

<p>By and by I came to a great, wide plain that stretched
<a name="II_Page_60"></a>away like a tideless summer sea. The wheat and lentils
and pulse were planted in long strips. In one place I
thought I could trace the good old American flag (that
you never really love unless you are on a foreign shore)
made with alternate strips of millet and peas, with a
goodly patch of cabbages in the corner for stars. But
possibly this was imagination, for I had been thinking
that in a week it would be the Fourth of July and I was
far from home&mdash;in a land where firecrackers are
unknown.</p>

<p>Coming to a little rise of ground, I could see, lying calm
and quiet amid the world of rich, growing grain, the
town of Montargis. Across on the blue hillside was
Montargis Castle, framed in a mass of foliage. I stopped
to view the scene, and the echo of vesper-bells came
pealing gently over the miles, as the nodding poppies at
my feet bowed reverently in the breeze.</p>

<p>Villages in France viewed from a distance seem so
restful and idyllic. There is no sound of strife, no trace
of rivalry, no vain pride; only white houses&mdash;the homes
of good men and gentle women, and cherub children;
and all the church-steeples truly point to God. Yet on
closer view&mdash;but what of that!</p>

<p>When I reached the town, the church whose spire I had
seen from the distance beckoned me first. I turned off
from the wide thoroughfare, intending just to get a
glance at the outside of the building as I passed. But
the great iron gates thrown invitingly open, and a rusty,
<a name="II_Page_61"></a>dusty dog of Flanders lying in the entry waiting for his
master, told me that there was service within. So I
entered, passing through the noiseless, swinging door,
and into the dim twilight of the house of prayer. A score
of people were there, and standing in the aisle was a
white-robed priest. He was speaking, and his voice
came so gently, so sure withal, so exquisitely modulated,
that I paused and, leaning against a pillar, listened. I
think it was the first time I ever heard a preacher
speaking in a large church who did not speak so loud
that an echo chased his sentences round and round the
vaulted dome and strangled the sense. The tone was
conversational and the manner so free from canting
conventionality that I moved up closer to get a view
of the face.</p>

<p>It was too dark to see well, but I came under the spell
of the man's earnest eloquence. The sacred stillness, the
falling night, the odor from incense and banks of flowers
piled about the feet of an image of the Holy Virgin&mdash;evidently
brought by the peasantry, having nothing
else to give&mdash;made a combination of melting conditions
that would have subdued a heart of stone.</p>

<p>The preacher ceased to speak, and as he raised his hands
in benediction, I, involuntarily, with the other worshipers,
knelt on the stone floor and bowed my head in
silent reverie.</p>

<p>Suddenly, I was aroused by a crashing noise at my
elbow, and glancing round saw that an old man near me
<a name="II_Page_62"></a>had merely dropped his cane. A heavy cudgel it was
that falling on the stone flagging sent a thundering
reverberation through the vaulted chambers.</p>

<p>The worshipers were slipping out, one by one, and soon
no one was left but the old man of the cudgel and myself.
He wore wooden shoes, and was holding the cordwood
fast between his knees, rolling his hat nervously in his
big hands. &quot;He's a stranger, too,&quot; I said to myself;
&quot;he is the man who owns the rusty dog of Flanders,
and he is waiting to give the priest some message!&quot;</p>

<p>I leaned over towards my neighbor and asked, &quot;The
priest&mdash;what is his name?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Father Francis, Monsieur!&quot; and the old man swayed
back and forward in his seat as if moved by some inward
emotion, still fingering his hat.</p>

<p>Just then the priest came out from behind the altar,
wearing a black robe instead of the white one. He moved
down with a sort of quiet majesty straight towards us.
We arose as one man; it was as though some one had
pressed a button.</p>

<p>Father Francis walked by me, bowing slightly, and
shook hands with my old neighbor. They stood talking
in an undertone.</p>

<p>A last struggling ray of light from the dying sun came in
over the chancel and flooded the great room for an
instant. It allowed me to get a good look at the face
of the priest. As I stood there staring at him I heard
him say to the old man as he bade him good-by, &quot;Yes,
<a name="II_Page_63"></a>tell her I'll be there in the morning.&quot;</p>

<p>Then he turned to me, and I was still staring. And as I stared I
was repeating to myself the words the people said when
Dante used to pass, &quot;There is the man who has been
to Hell!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You are an Englishman?&quot; said Father Francis to
me pleasantly as he held out his hand.
&quot;Yes,&quot; I said; &quot;I am an Englishman&mdash;that is, no&mdash;an
American!&quot;</p>

<p>I was wondering if he had really heard me make that
Dante remark; and anyway, I had been rudely staring
at him and listening with both ears to his conversation
with the old man. I tried to roll my hat, and had I a
cudgel I would surely have dropped it; and with it all I
wondered if the dog of Flanders waiting outside was
not getting impatient for me!</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, an American! I'm glad&mdash;I have very dear friends
in America!&quot;</p>

<p>Then I saw that Father Francis did not look so much
like the exiled Florentine as I had thought, for his smile
was winning as that of a woman, the corners of his
mouth did not turn down, and the nose had not the
Roman curve. Dante was an exile: this man was at
home&mdash;and would have been, anywhere.</p>

<p>He was tall, slender and straight; he must have been
sixty years old, but the face in spite of its furrows was
singularly handsome. Grave, yet not depressed, it
showed such feminine delicacy of feeling, such grace,
<a name="II_Page_64"></a>such high intellect, that I stood and gazed as I might
at a statue in bronze. But plain to see, he was a man
of sorrow and acquainted with grief. The face spake
of one to whom might have come a great tribulation,
and who by accepting it had purchased redemption
for all time from all the petty troubles of earth.</p>

<p>&quot;You must stay here as long as you wish, and you
will come to our old church again, I hope!&quot; said the
Father. He smiled, nodded his head and started to
leave me alone.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, yes, I'll come again&mdash;I'll come in the morning,
for I want to talk with you about Madame Guyon&mdash;she
was married in this church they told me&mdash;is that
true?&quot; I clutched a little. Here was a man I could not
afford to lose&mdash;one of the elect!</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, yes; that was a long time ago, though. Are you
interested in Madame Guyon? I am glad&mdash;not to
know Fenelon seems a misfortune. He used to preach
from that very pulpit, and Madame was baptized at
that font and confirmed here. I have pictures of them
both; and I have their books&mdash;one of the books is a
first edition. Do you care for such things?&quot;</p>

<p>When I was broke in London, in the Fall of Eighty-nine!
Do I care for such things? I can not recall what
I said, but I remembered that this brown-skinned
priest with his liquid, black eyes, and the look of
sorrow on his handsome face, stood out before me like
the picture of a saint.</p>
<p><a name="II_Page_65"></a></p>
<p>I made an engagement to meet him the next morning,
when he bethought him of his promise to the old man
of the cudgel and wooden shoes.</p>

<p>&quot;Come now, then&mdash;come with me now. My house is
just next door!&quot;</p>

<p>And so we walked up the main aisle of the old church,
around the altar where Madame Guyon used to kneel,
and by a crooked, little passageway entered a house
fully as old as the church. A woman who might have
been as old as the house was setting the table in a
little dining-room. She looked up at me through brass-rimmed
spectacles, and without orders or any one
saying a word she whisked off the tablecloth, replaced it
with a snowy, clean one, and put on two plates instead
of one. Then she brought in toasted brown bread and
tea, and a steaming dish of lentils, and fresh-picked
berries in a basket all lined with green leaves.</p>

<p>It was not a very sumptuous repast, but 't was enough.
Afterward I learned that Father Francis was a vegetarian.
He did not tell me so, neither did he apologize
for absence of fermented drink, nor for his failure to
supply tobacco and pipes.</p>

<p>Now, I have heard that there be priests who hold in
their cowled heads choice recipes for spiced wines, and
who carry hidden away in their hearts all the mysteries
of the chafing-dish; but Father Francis was not one
of these. His form was thin, but the bronze of his face
was the bronze that comes from red corpuscles, and
<a name="II_Page_66"></a>the strongly corded neck and calloused, bony hands
told of manly abstinence and exercise in the open air,
and sleep that follows peaceful thoughts, knowing no
chloral.</p>

<p>After the meal, Father Francis led the way to his little
study upstairs. He showed me his books and read to
me from his one solitary &quot;First Edition.&quot; Then he
unlocked a little drawer in an old chiffonier and brought
out a package all wrapped in chamois. This parcel
held two miniature portraits, one of Fenelon and one
of Madame Guyon.</p>

<p>&quot;That picture of Fenelon belonged to Madame Guyon.
He had it painted for her and sent it to her while she
was in prison at Vincennes. The other I bought in
Paris&mdash;I do not know its history.&quot;</p>

<p>The good priest had work to do, and let me know it
very gently, thus: &quot;You have come a long way,
brother, the road was rough&mdash;I know you must be
weary. Come, I'll show you to your room.&quot;</p>

<p>He lighted a candle and took me to a bedroom at the
end of the hall. It was a little room, very clean, but
devoid of all ornament, save a picture of the Madonna
and her Babe, that hung over the head of the little
iron bedstead. It was a painting&mdash;not very good. I
think Father Francis painted it himself; the face of
the Holy Mother was very human&mdash;divinely human&mdash;as
motherhood should be.</p>

<p>Father Francis was right:
the way had been rough and I was tired.</p>
<p><a name="II_Page_67"></a></p>
<p>The treetops sang a cooing lullaby and the nightwinds
sighed solemnly as they wandered through the
hallway and open doors. It did not take me long to
go to sleep. Later, the wind blew up fresh and cool.
I was too sleepy to get up and hunt for more covering,
and yet I was cold as I curled up in a knot and dreamed
I was first mate with Peary on an expedition in search
of the North Pole. And the last I remember was a
vision of a gray-robed priest tiptoeing across the stone
floor; of his throwing over me a heavy blanket and
then hastily tiptoeing out again.</p>

<p>The matin-bells, or the birds, or both, awoke me early,
but when I got downstairs I found my host had preceded
me. His fine face looked fresh and strong, and
yet I wondered when he had slept.</p>

<p>After breakfast, the old housekeeper hovered near.</p>

<p>&quot;What is it, Margaret?&quot; said the Father, gently.</p>

<p>&quot;You haven't forgotten your engagement?&quot; asked
the woman, with just a quaver of anxiety.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh no, Margaret&quot;; then turning to me, &quot;Come, you
shall go with me&mdash;we will talk of Fenelon and Madame
Guyon as we walk. It is eight miles and back, but you
will not mind the distance. Oh, didn't I tell you where
I'm going? You saw the old man at the church last
night&mdash;it is his daughter&mdash;she is dying&mdash;dying of
consumption. She has not been a good girl. She went
away to Paris, three years ago, and her parents never
heard from her. We tried to find her, but could not;
<a name="II_Page_68"></a>and now she has come home of her own accord&mdash;come
home to die. I baptized her twenty years ago&mdash;how
fast the time has flown!&quot;</p>

<p>The priest took a stout staff from the corner, and
handing me its mate we started away. Down the
white, dusty highway we went; out on the stony road
where yesterday, as the darkness gathered, trudged
an old man in wooden shoes and with a cordwood
cudgel&mdash;at his heels a dog of Flanders.</p>

<p>I believe it was Thackeray who
once expressed a regret that Harriet
Martineau had not shown
better judgment in choosing her
parents.</p>

<p>She was born into one of those
big families where there is not love
enough to go 'round. The mother
was a robustious woman with a termagant temper;
she was what you call &quot;practical.&quot; She arose each
morning, like Solomon's ideal wife, while it was yet
dark, and proceeded to set her house in order. She
made the children go to bed when they were not
sleepy and get up when they were. There was no
beauty-sleep in that household, not even forty winks;
and did any member prove recreant and require a
douse of cold water, not only did he get the douse but
he also heard quoted for a year and a day that remark
concerning the sluggard, &quot;A little sleep, a little slumber,
a little folding of the hands to sleep: so shall thy
poverty come as one that traveleth, and thy want as
an armed man.&quot;</p>

<p>This big, bustling Amazon was never known to weep
but once, and that was when Lord Nelson died. To show
any emotion would have been to reveal a weakness,
and a caress would have been proof positive of folly.
<a name="II_Page_74"></a>Life was a stern business and this earth-journey a
warfare. She cooked, she swept, she scrubbed, she
sewed.</p>

<p>And although she withheld every loving word and
kept back all demonstration of affection, yet her children
were always well cared for: they were well clothed,
they had plenty to eat, and a warm place to sleep.
And in times of sickness this mother would send all
others to rest, and herself would watch by the bedside
until the shadows stole away and the sunrise came
again. I wonder where you have lived all your life if
you have never known a woman like that?</p>

<p>In the morning, as soon as the breakfast things were
done and the men folks had gone to the cloth-factory,
Mrs. Martineau would marshal her daughters in the
sitting-room to sew. And there they sewed for four
hours every forenoon for more than four years; and as
they sewed some one would often read aloud to them,
for Mrs. Martineau believed in education&mdash;education
gotten on the wing.</p>

<p>Sewing-machines and knitting-machines have done
more to emancipate women than all the preachers.
Think of the days when every garment worn by men,
women and children was made by the never-resting
hands of women!</p>

<p>And as the girls in that thrifty Norwich household
sewed and listened to the reader, they occasionally
spoke in monotone of what was read&mdash;-all save Harriet:
<a name="II_Page_75"></a>Harriet sewed. And the other girls thought Harriet
very dull, and her mother was sure of it, and called her
stupid, and sometimes shook her and railed at her,
endeavoring to arouse her out of her lethargy.</p>

<p>Harriet has herself left on record somewhat of her
feelings in those days. In her child-heart there was a
great aching void. Her life was wrong&mdash;the lives about
her were wrong&mdash;she did not know how, and could not
then trace the subject far enough to tell why. She was
a-hungered, she longed for tenderness, for affection
and the close confidence that knows no repulse. She
wanted them all to throw down their sewing for just
five minutes, and sit in the silence with folded hands.
She longed for her mother to hold her on her lap so,
that she could pillow her head on her shoulder with
her arms about her neck, and have a real good cry.
Then all her troubles and pains would be gone.</p>

<p>But the slim little girl never voiced any of these foolish
thoughts; she knew better. She choked back her
tears and leaning over her sewing tried hard to be
&quot;good.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;She is so stupid that she never listens to what one
reads to her,&quot; said her mother one day.</p>

<p>One of that family still lives. I saw him not long ago
and talked with him face to face concerning some of
the things here written&mdash;Doctor James Martineau,
ninety-two years old.</p>

<p>The others are all dead now&mdash;all are gone. In the
<a name="II_Page_76"></a>cemetery at Norwich is a plain, slate slab, &quot;To the
Memory of Elizabeth Martineau, Mother of Harriet
Martineau.&quot; * * * And so she sleeps, remembered for what?
As the mother of a stupid little girl who
tried hard to be good, but didn't succeed very well,
and who did not listen when they read aloud.</p>
<p><a name="II_Page_77"></a></p>
<hr />
<p>It seems sometimes that there is no such
thing as a New Year&mdash;it is only the old
year come back. These folks about us&mdash;have
they not lived before? Surely they
are the same creatures that have peopled earth in the
days agone; they are busy about the same things, they
chase after the same trifles, they commit the same
mistakes, and blunder as men have always blundered.</p>

<p>Only last week, a teacher in one of the primary
schools of Chicago reported to her principal that a
certain little boy in her room was so hopelessly dull
and perverse that she despaired of teaching him anything.
The child would sit with open mouth and look
at her as she would talk to the class, and five minutes
afterward he could not or would not repeat three words
of what had been said. She had scolded him, made him
stand on the floor, kept him in after school, and even
whipped him&mdash;but all in vain. The principal looked
into the case, scratched his head, stroked his whiskers,
coughed, and decided that the public-school funds
should not be wasted in trying to &quot;teach imbeciles,&quot;
and so reported to the parents. He advised them to
send the boy to a Home for the Feeble-Minded, sending
the message by an older brother. So the parents
took the child to the Home and asked that he be admitted.
The Matron took the little boy on her lap,
talked to him, read to him, showed him pictures and
said to the astonished parents, &quot;This child has fully
<a name="II_Page_78"></a>as much intelligence as any of your other children,
perhaps more&mdash;but he is deaf!&quot;</p>

<p>Harriet Martineau from her twelfth year was very
deaf, and she was also devoid of the senses of taste
and smell.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, these are terrible tribulations to befall a mortal!&quot;
we exclaim with uplifted hands. But on sober second
thought I am not sure that I know what is a tribulation
and what a blessing. I'm not positive that I would
know a blessing should I see it coming up the street.
For as I write it comes to me that the Great Big Black
Things that have loomed against the horizon of my
life, threatening to devour me, simply loomed and
nothing more. They harmed me not. The things that
have really made me miss my train have always been
sweet, soft, pretty, pleasant things of which I was not
in the, least afraid.</p>

<p>Mother Nature is kind, and if she deprives us of one
thing she gives us another, and happiness seems to be
meted out to each and all in equal portions. Harriet's
afflictions caused her to turn her mind to other things
than those which filled the hearts of girls of her own
age. Society chatter held nothing for her, she could
not hear it if she would; and she ate the food that
agreed with her, not that which was merely pleasant
to the taste. She began to live in a world of thought
and ideas. The silence meant much.</p>

<p>&quot;The first requisite is that man should be a good
<a name="II_Page_79"></a>animal.&quot; I used to think that Herbert Spencer in
voicing this aphorism struck twelve. But I am no
longer enthusiastic about the remark. The senses of
most dumb animals are far better developed than
those of man. Hounds can trace footsteps over flat
rocks, even though a shower has fallen in the interval;
cats can see in the dark; rabbits hear sounds that men
never hear; horses detect an impurity in water that a
chemical analysis does not reveal, and homing pigeons
would gain nothing by carrying a compass. And so I
feel safe in saying that if any man were so good and
perfect an animal that he had the hound's sense of
smell, the cat's eyesight, the rabbit's sense of hearing,
the horse's sense of taste, and the homing pigeon's
&quot;locality,&quot; he would not be one whit better prepared
to appreciate Kipling's &quot;Dipsy Chanty,&quot; and not a
hair's breadth nearer a point where he could write a
poem equal to it.</p>

<p>No college professor can see so far as a Sioux Indian,
neither can he hear so well as a native African. There
are rays of light that no unaided human eye can trace,
and there are sounds subtler than human ear can detect.
These five bodily faculties that we are pleased to call
the senses were developed by savage man. He holds
them in common with the brute. And now that man
is becoming partly civilized he is in danger of losing
them. Faculties not used are taken away. Dame Nature
seems to consider that anything you do not utilize is
<a name="II_Page_80"></a>not needed; and as she is averse to carrying dead
freight she drops it out.</p>

<p>But man can think, and the more he thinks and the
further he projects his thought, the less need he has
for his physical senses. Homer's matchless vision was
the rich possession of a blind man; Milton never saw
Paradise until he was sightless, and Helen Keller
knows a world of things that were neither told to her in
lectures nor read from books. The far-reaching intellect
often goes with a singularly imperfect body, and these
things seem to point to the truth that the body is one
thing and the soul another.</p>

<p>I make no argument for impoverished vitality, nor do I
plead the cause of those who enjoy poor health. Yet
how often do we find that the confessional of a family
or a neighborhood is the bedside of one who sees the
green fields only as did the Lady of Shalott, by holding
a looking-glass so that it reflects the out-of-doors.
Let me carry that simile one step further, and say that
the mirror of the soul when kept free from fleck and
stain, reveals the beauties of the universe. And I am
not sure but that the soul, freed from the distractions
of sense and the trammels of flesh, glides away to a
height where things are observed for the first time in
their true proportions.</p>

<p>&quot;The soul knows all things,&quot; says Emerson, &quot;and knowledge
is only a remembering.&quot;</p>
<p><a name="II_Page_81"></a></p>
<hr />

<p>The Martineaus were Huguenots, a stern,
sturdy stock that suffered exile rather than
forego the right of free-thought and free
speech. These are the people who are the salt
of the earth. And yet as I read history I see that they are
the people who have been hunted by dogs, and followed
by armed men carrying fagots. The driving of the
Huguenots from France came near bankrupting the land,
and the flight of Jews and Huguenots into England
helped largely to make that country the counting-house
of the world. Take the Quakers, Puritans, Huguenots
and other refugees from America and it is no longer
the land of the free or the home of the brave.</p>

<p>Of the seven Presidents who presided over the deliberations
of that first Continental Congress in Philadelphia,
three were Huguenots: Henry Laurens, John Jay and
Elias Boudinot, and in the seats there were Puritans
not a few.</p>

<p>&quot;By God, Sir, we can not afford to persecute the
Quakers,&quot; said a certain American a long while ago.
&quot;Their religion may be wrong, but the people who cling
to an idea are the only people we need. If we must
persecute, let us persecute the complacent.&quot;</p>

<p>Harriet Martineau had all the restless independence
of will that marked her ancestry. She set herself to
acquire knowledge, and she did. When she was twenty
she spoke three languages and could read in four.
She knew history, astronomy, physical science, and it
<a name="II_Page_82"></a>crowded her teacher in mathematics very hard to keep
one lesson in advance of her. Besides, she could sew
and cook and &quot;keep house.&quot; Yet it was all gathered
by labor and toil and lift. By taking thought she had
added cubits to her stature.</p>

<p>But at twenty, a great light suddenly shone around her.
Love came and revealed the wonders of Earth and
Heaven. She had ever been of a religious nature, but
now her religion was vitalized and spiritualized. Deity
was no longer a Being who dwelt at a great distance
among the stars, but the Divine Life was hers. It flowed
through her, nourished her and gave her strength.</p>

<p>Renan suggests that one reason why religion remains
on such a material plane for many is because they
have never known a great and vitalizing love&mdash;a love
where intellect, spirit and sex find their perfect mate.
Love is the great enlightener. And in my own mind I
am fully persuaded that comparatively few mortals
ever experience this rebirth that a great love gives.
We grope our way through life. Nature's first thought
is for reproduction of the species; she has so overloaded
physical passion that men and women marry when
the blood is warm and intellect callow. Girls marry
for life the first man that offers, and forever put behind
them the possibilities of a love that would enable them
to lift up their eyes to the hills from whence cometh
their help. Very, very seldom do the years that bring
a calmer pulse reveal a mating of mind and spirit.</p>
<p><a name="II_Page_83"></a></p>
<p>When love came to Harriet, she began to write, her
first book being a little volume called &quot;Devotional
Exercises.&quot; These daily musings on Divine things
and these sweetly limpid prayers were all written out
first for herself and her lover. But it came to her that
what was a help to them might be a help to others.
A publisher was found, and the little work had a large
sale and found appreciative readers for many years.</p>

<p>Today, out under the trees, I read this first book written
by Miss Martineau. How gently sweet and perfect
are these prayers asking for a clean heart and a right
spirit! And yet at this time Harriet Martineau had
gotten well beyond the idea that God was a great, big
man who could be beseeched and moved to alter His
plans because some creature on the planet Earth asked
it. Her religion was pure Theism, with no confounding
dogmas about who was to be saved and who damned.
The state of infants who died unbaptized and of the
heathen who passed away without ever having heard
of Jesus did not trouble her at all. She already accepted
the truth of necessity, believing that every act of life
was the result of a cause. We do what we do, and are
what we are, on account of impulses given us by previous training,
previous acts or conditions under which we live and have lived.</p>

<p>If then, everything in this world happens because
something else happened a thousand years ago or
yesterday, and the result could not possibly be different
<a name="II_Page_84"></a>from what it is, why besiege Heaven with prayers?</p>

<p>The answer is simple. Prayer is an emotional exercise;
an endeavor to bring the will into a state of harmony
with the Divine Will; a rest and a composure that gives
strength by putting us in position to partake of the
strength of the Universal. The man who prays today is
as a result stronger tomorrow, and thus is prayer
answered. By right thinking does the race grow. An act
is only a crystallized thought; and this young girl's
little book was designed as a help to right thinking.
The things it taught are so simple that no man need
go to a theological seminary to learn them: the Silence
will tell him all if he will but listen and incline his heart.
Love had indeed made Harriet's spirit free. And to no
woman can love mean so much as to one who is aware
that she is physically deficient. Homely women are apt
to make the better wives, and in all my earth-pilgrimage
I never saw a more devoted love&mdash;a diviner tenderness&mdash;than
that which exists between a man of my acquaintance,
sound in every sense and splendid in physique,
and his wife, who has been blind from her birth. For
weeks after I first met this couple there rang in my ears
that expression of Victor Hugo's, &quot;To be blind and to
be loved&mdash;what happier fate!&quot;</p>

<p>But Harriet's lover
was poor in purse and his family was likewise poor,
and the thrifty Martineaus vigorously opposed the mating.
In fact, Harriet's mother hooted at it and spoke of it
with scorn; and Harriet answered not back, but hid
<a name="II_Page_85"></a>her love away in her heart&mdash;biding the time when her
lover should make for himself a name and a place, and
have money withal to command the respect of even
mill-owners.</p>

<p>So the days passed, and the months went by, and three
years counted themselves with the eternity that lies
behind. Harriet's lover had indeed proved himself
worthy. He had worked his way through college, had
been graduated at the Divinity School, and his high
reputation for character and his ability as a speaker
won for him at once a position to which many older
than he aspired. He became the pastor of the Unitarian
Church at Manchester&mdash;and this was no small matter!</p>

<p>Now Norwich, where the Martineaus lived, is a long
way from Manchester, where Harriet's lover preached,
or it was then, in stagecoach times. It cost money, too,
to send letters.</p>

<p>And there was quite an interval once when Harriet
sent several letters, and anxiously looked for one; but
none arrived.</p>

<p>Then word came that the brilliant young preacher was
ill; he wished to see his betrothed. She started to go to
him, but her parents opposed such an unprecedented
thing. She hesitated, deferred her visit&mdash;intending soon
to go at all hazards&mdash;hoping all the while to hear better
news.</p>

<p>Word came that Harriet's lover was dead.
Soon after this the Martineau mills, through various
<a name="II_Page_86"></a>foolish speculations, got into a bad way. Harriet's father
found himself with more debts than he could pay; his
endeavors to buffet the storm broke his health&mdash;he gave
up hope, languished and died.</p>

<p>Mrs. Martineau and the family were thus suddenly
deprived of all means of support. The boys were sent
to work in the mills, and the two older girls, having five
sound senses each, found places where they could do
housework and put money in their purses.
Harriet Martineau stayed at home and kept house.
She also studied, read and wrote a little&mdash;there was
no other way!</p>
<p><a name="II_Page_87"></a></p>
<hr />

<p>Six years passed, and the name of Harriet
Martineau was recognized as a power in the
land. Her &quot;Illustrations of Political Economy&quot;
had sold well up into the hundred
thousands. The little stories were read by old and young,
rich and poor, learned and unlearned. Sir Robert Peel
had written Harriet a personal letter of encouragement;
Lord Brougham had paid for and given away a thousand
copies of the booklets; Richard Cobden had publicly
endorsed them; Coleridge had courted the author;
Florence Nightingale had sung her praises, and the
Czar of Russia had ordered that &quot;all the books of
Harriet Martineau's found in Russia shall be destroyed.&quot;
Besides, she had incurred the wrath of King Philippe of
France, who after first lavishly praising her and ordering
the &quot;Illustrations&quot; translated into French, to be used
in the public schools, suddenly discovered a hot chapter
entitled, &quot;The Error Called the Divine Right of
Kings,&quot; and although Philippe was only a &quot;citizen-king&quot;
he made haste to recall his kind words.</p>

<p>And I wish here to remark in parentheses that the
author who has not made warm friends and then lost
them in an hour by writing things that did not agree
with the preconceived idea of these friends, has either
not written well or not been read. Every preacher who
preaches ably has two doors to his church&mdash;one where
the people come in and another through which he
preaches them out. And I do not see how any man,
<a name="II_Page_88"></a>even though he be divine, could expect or hope to have
as many as twelve disciples and hold them for three
years without being doubted, denied and betrayed. If
you have thoughts, and honestly speak your mind,
Golgotha for you is not far away.</p>

<p>Harriet Martineau was essentially an agitator. She
entered into life in its fullest sense, and no phase of
existence escaped her keen and penetrating investigation.
From writing books giving minute directions to
housemaids, to lengthy advice to prime ministers, her
work never lagged. She was widely read, beloved,
respected, feared and well hated.</p>

<p>When her political-economy tales were selling their
best, the Government sent her word that on application
she could have a pension of two hundred pounds a year
for life. A pension of this kind comes nominally as a
reward for excellent work or heroic service. But a
pension may mean something else: it often implies that
the receiver shall not offend nor affront the one that
bestows it. Could we trace the true inner history of
pensions granted by monarchies, we would find that
they are usually diplomatic moves.</p>

<p>Harriet made no response to the generous offer of a
lifelong maintenance from the State, but continued to
work away after her own methods. Yet the offer of a
pension did her good in one way: it suggested the
wisdom of setting aside a sum that would support her
when her earning powers were diminished. From her
<a name="II_Page_89"></a>two books written concerning her trip to America she
received the sum of seven thousand five hundred dollars.
With this she purchased an insurance policy in the form
of a deferred annuity, providing that from her fiftieth
year to her death she should receive the annual sum of
five hundred dollars. Nowhere in all the realm of Grub
Street do we find a man who set such an example of cool
wisdom for this crippled woman. At this time she was
supporting her mother, who had become blind, and also
a brother, who was a slave to drink.</p>

<p>Twenty-five years after the first offer of pension, the
Government renewed the proposition. But Harriet
said that her needs were few and her wants simple; that
she had enough anyway, and besides, she could not consent
to the policy of pensioning one class of persons for
well-doing and forgetting all the toilers who have
worked just as conscientiously, but along lowly lines; if
she ever did need aid, she would do as other old women
were obliged to do, that is, apply to the parish.</p>

<p>Miss Martineau wrote for the &quot;Daily London News&quot;
alone, sixteen hundred forty-two editorials. She also
wrote more than two hundred magazine articles, and
published upwards of fifty books. Her work was not
classic, for it was written for the times. That her influence
for good on the thought of the times was wide and far-reaching,
all thoughtful men agree. And he who influences
the thought of his times influences all the times
that follow. He has made his impress on eternity.</p>
<p><a name="II_Page_90"></a></p>
<hr />

<p>Opinions may differ as to what constitutes
Harriet Martineau's best work, but my view
is that her translation and condensation of
Auguste Comte's six volumes into two will
live when all her other work is forgotten. Comte's own
writings were filled with many repetitions and rhetorical
flounderings. He was more of a philosopher than a
writer. He had an idea too big for him to express, but he
expressed at it right bravely. Miss Martineau, trained
writer and thinker, did not translate verbally: she
caught the idea, and translated the thought rather than
the language. And so it has come about that her work
has been literally translated back into French and is
accepted as a textbook of Positivism, while the original
books of the philosopher are merely collected by
museums and bibliophiles as curiosities.</p>

<p>Comte taught that man passes through three distinct
mental stages in his development: First, man attributes
all phenomena to a &quot;Personal God,&quot; and to this God
he servilely prays. Second, he believes in a &quot;Supreme
Essence,&quot; a &quot;Universal Principle&quot; or a &quot;First Cause,&quot;
and seeks to discover its hiding-place. Third, he ceases
to hunt out the unknowable, and is content to live and
work for a positive present good, fully believing that
what is best today can not fail to bring the best results
tomorrow.</p>

<p>Harriet had long considered that one reason for the
very slow advancement of civilization was that men
<a name="II_Page_91"></a>had ever busied themselves with supernatural concerns;
and in fearsome endeavors to make themselves secure
for another world had neglected this. Man had tried
to make peace with the skies instead of peace with his
neighbor. She also thought she saw clearly that right
living was one thing, and a belief in theological dogma
another. That these things sometimes go together, she
of course admitted, but a belief in a &quot;vicarious atonement&quot;
and a &quot;miraculous conception&quot; she did not
believe made a man a gentler husband, a better neighbor
or a more patriotic citizen. Man does what he does
because he thinks at the moment it is the best thing
to do. And if you could make men believe that peace,
truth, honesty and industry were the best standards to
adopt&mdash;bringing the best results&mdash;all men would adopt
them.</p>

<p>There are no such things as reward and punishment, as
these terms are ordinarily used: there are only good
results and bad results. We sow, and reap what we have
sown.</p>

<p>Miss Martineau had long believed these things, but
Comte proved them&mdash;proved them in six ponderous
tomes&mdash;and she set herself the task to simplify his
philosophy.</p>

<p>There is one point of attraction that Comte's thought
had for Harriet Martineau that I have never seen
mentioned in print&mdash;that is, his mental attitude on the
value of love in a well-ordered life.</p>
<p><a name="II_Page_92"></a></p>
<p>In the springtime of his manhood, Auguste Comte,
sensitive, confiding, generous, loved a beautiful girl.
She did not share his intellectual ambitions, his divine
aspiration: she was only a beautiful animal. Man
proposes, but is not always accepted. She married
another, and Comte was disconsolate&mdash;for a day.</p>

<p>He pondered the subject, read the lives of various great
men, talked with monks and sundry friars gray, and
after five years wrote out at length the reasons why a
man, in order to accomplish a far-reaching and splendid
work, must live the life of a celibate. &quot;To achieve,&quot;
said Comte, &quot;you must be married to your work.&quot;</p>

<p>Comte lived for some time content in this philosophy,
constantly strengthening it and buttressing it against
attack; for we believe a thing first and skirmish for our
proof afterward. But when past forty, and his hair was
turning to silver, and crow's-feet were showing themselves
in his fine face, and when there was a halt in his
step and his laughter had died away into a weary smile,
he met a woman whose nature was as finely sensitive
and as silkenly strong as his own. She had intellect,
aspiration, power. She was gentle, and a womanly
woman withal; his best mood was matched by hers, she
sympathized with his highest ideal.</p>

<p>They loved and they married.</p>

<p>The crow's-feet disappeared from Comte's face, the
halt in his step was gone, the laugh returned, and people
said that the silver in his hair was becoming.</p>
<p><a name="II_Page_93"></a></p>
<p>Shortly after, Comte set himself to work overhauling all
the foolish things he had said about the necessity of
celibacy. He declared that a man without his mate only
stumbled his way through life. There was the male man
and the female man, and only by working together
could these two souls hope to progress. It requires two
to generate thought. Comte felt sure that he was writing
the final word. He avowed that there was no more to
say. He declared that should his wife go hence the fountains
of his soul would dry up, his mind would famish,
and the light of his life would go out in darkness.</p>

<p>The gods were envious of such love as this.</p>

<p>Comte's mate passed away.</p>

<p>He was stricken dumb; the calamity was too great for
speech or tears.</p>

<p>But five years after, he got down his books and went
over his manuscripts and again revised his philosophy
of what constitutes the true condition for the highest
and purest thought. To have known a great and exalted
love and have it fade from your grasp and flee as
shadow, living only in memory, is the highest good, he
wrote. A great sorrow at one stroke purchases a redemption
from all petty troubles; it sinks all trivial annoyances
into nothingness, and grants the man lifelong
freedom from all petty, corroding cares. His feelings
have been sounded to their depths&mdash;the plummet has
touched bottom. Fate has done her worst: she has
brought him face to face with the Supreme Calamity,
<a name="II_Page_94"></a>and thereafter there is nothing that can inspire terror.</p>

<p>The memory of a great love can never die from out
the heart. It affords a ballast 'gainst all the storms that
blow. And although it lends an unutterable sadness, it
imparts an unspeakable peace.</p>

<p>A great love, even when fully possessed, affords no
complete gratification. There is an essence in it that
eludes all ownership. Its highest use seems to be a
purifying impulse for nobler endeavor. It says at the
last, &quot;Arise, and get thee hence, for this is not thy
rest.&quot;</p>

<p>Where there is this haunting memory of a great love
lost there is always forgiveness, charity, and a sympathy
that makes the man brother to all who endure and suffer.
The individual himself is nothing; he has nothing to
hope for, nothing to gain, nothing to win, nothing to
lose; for the first time and the last he has a selflessness
that is wide as the world, and wherein there is no room
for the recollection of a wrong. In this memory of a
great love, there is a nourishing source of strength by
which the possessor lives and works; he is in communication
with elemental conditions.</p>

<p>Harriet Martineau was a lifelong widow of the heart.
That first great passion of her early womanhood, the
love that was lost, remained with her all the days of her
life: springing fresh every morning, her last thought as
she closed her eyes at night. Other loves came to her,
attachments varying in nature and degree, but in this
<a name="II_Page_95"></a>supreme love all was fused and absorbed. In this love,
you get the secret of power.</p>

<p>A great love is a pain, yet it is a benison and a benediction.
If we carry any possession from this world to
another it is the memory of a great love. For even in the
last hour, when the coldness of death shall creep into
the stiffening limbs, and the brain shall be stunned and
the thoughts stifled, there shall come to the tongue a
name, a name not mentioned aloud for years&mdash;there
shall come a name; and as the last flickering rays of life
flare up to go out on earth forever, the tongue will speak
this name that was long, long ago burned into the soul
by the passion of a love that fadeth not away.

<div class="blkquot"><p>I was not surprised, when I went down into the hall,
to see that a brilliant June morning had succeeded to the
tempest of the night, and to feel through the open glass
door the breathing of a fresh and fragrant breeze.
Nature must be gladsome when I was so happy. A
beggar woman and her little boy, pale, ragged objects
both, were coming up the walk, and I ran down and
gave them all the money I happened to have in my
purse&mdash;some three or four shillings: good or bad they
must partake of my jubilee. The rooks cawed and
blither birds sung, but nothing was so merry or so
musical as my own rejoicing heart.<br />

<p>Rumor has it that there be Americans
who are never happy unless
passing for Englishmen. And I think
I have discovered a like anomaly on
the part of the sons of Ireland&mdash;a
wish to pass for Frenchmen. On
Continental hotel-registers the good,
honest name of O'Brian often turns
queer somersaults, and more than once in &quot;The
States&quot; does the kingly prefix of O evolve itself into
Van or De, which perhaps is quite proper, seeing they
all mean the same thing. One cause of this tendency
may lie in the fact that Saint Patrick was a native of
France; although Saint Patrick may or may not have
been chosen patron saint on account of his nationality.
But the patron saint of Ireland being a Frenchman,
what more natural, and therefore what more proper,
than that the whole Emerald Isle should slant toward
the people who love art and rabbit-stew! Anyway, from
the proud patronymic of Patricius to plain Pat is quite
a drop, and my heart is with Paddy in his efforts to
get back.</p>

<p>When Patrick Prunty of County Down, Ireland, shook
off the shackles of environment, and the mud of the
peat-bog, and went across to England, presenting himself
at the gates of Saint John's College, Cambridge,
<a name="II_Page_102"></a>asking for admittance, I am glad he handed in his name
as Mr. P. Bronte, accent on the last syllable.</p>

<p>There is a gentle myth abroad that preachers are
&quot;called,&quot; while other men adopt a profession or get a
job, but no Protestant Episcopal clergyman I have ever
known, and I have known many, ever made any such
claim. They take up the profession because it supplies
honors and a &quot;living.&quot; Then they can do good, too, and
all men want to do good. So they hie them to a divinity
school and are taught the mysteries of theological tierce
and thrust; and interviewing a clerical tailor they are
ready to accept the honors and partake of the living.
After a careful study of the life of Patrick Bronte I can
not find that his ambition extended beyond the desirable
things I have named&mdash;that is to say, inclusively,
honors and a living.</p>

<p>He was tall, athletic, dark, and surely a fellow of force
and ambition to set his back on the old and boldly rap
for admittance at the gates of Cambridge. He was a
pretty good student, too, although a bit quarrelsome
and sometimes mischievous&mdash;throwing his force into
quite unnecessary ways, as Irishmen are apt to do. He
fell in love, of course, and has not an Irishman in love
been likened to Vesuvius in state of eruption? We know
of at least one charming girl who refused to marry him,
because he declined, unlike Othello, to tell the story of
his life. And it was assumed that any man who would
not tell who &quot;his folks&quot; were, was a rogue and a varlet
<a name="II_Page_103"></a>and a vagrom at heart. And all the while Monsieur
Bronte had nothing worse to conceal than that he was
from County Down and his name Prunty. He wouldn't
give in and tell the story of his life to slow music, and
so the girl wept and then stormed, and finally Bronte
stormed and went away, and the girl and her parents
were sure that the Frenchman was a murderer escaping
justice. Fortunate, aye, thrice fortunate is it for the
world that neither Bronte nor the girl wavered even in
the estimation of a hair.</p>

<p>Bronte got through school and came out with tuppence
worth of honors. When thirty, we find him established
as curate at the shabby little town of Hartshead, in
Yorkshire. Little Miss Branwell, from Penzance, came
up there on a visit to her uncle, and the Reverend Mr.
Bronte at once fell violently in love with her dainty
form and gentle ways. I say &quot;violently,&quot; for that's
the kind of man Bronte was. Darwin says, &quot;The faculty
of amativeness is not aroused except by the unfamiliar.&quot;
Girls who go away visiting, wearing their best bib and
tucker, find lovers without fail. One-third of all
marriages in the United States occur in just this way: the
bib and tucker being sprung on the young man as a
surprise, dazzles and hypnotizes him into an avowal
and an engagement.</p>

<p>And so they were married&mdash;were the Reverend Patrick
Bronte and Miss Maria Branwell. He was big, bold and
dictatorial; she was little, shy and sensitive. The babies
<a name="II_Page_104"></a>came&mdash;one in less than a year, then a year apart. The
dainty little woman had her troubles, we are sure of
that. Her voice comes to us only as a plaintive echo.
When she asked to have the bread passed, she always
apologized. Once her aunt sent her a present of a pretty
silk dress, for country clergymen's wives do not have
many luxuries&mdash;don't you know that?&mdash;and Patrick
Bronte cut the dress into strips before her eyes and then
threw the pieces, and the little slippers to match, into
the fireplace, to teach his wife humility. He used to
practise with a pistol and shoot in the house to steady
the lady's nerves, and occasionally he got plain drunk.
A man like Bronte in a little town with a tired little wife,
and with inferior people, is a despot. He busies himself
with trifles, looks after foolish details, and the neighbors
let him have his own way and his wife has to,
and the result is that he becomes convinced in his own
mind that he is the people and that wisdom will die
with him.</p>

<p>And yet Bronte wrote some pretty good poetry, and
had faculties that rightly developed might have made
him an excellent man. He should have gone down to
London (or up, because it is south) and there come into
competition with men as strong as himself. Fate should
have seized him by the hair and bumped his head against
stone walls and cuffed him thoroughly, and kicked him
into line, teaching him humility, then out of the scrimmage
we might have gotten a really superior product.</p>

<p><a name="II_Page_105"></a>Mrs. Bronte became a confirmed invalid. A man can
not always badger a woman; God is good&mdash;she dies.
Little Maria Branwell had been married eight years;
when she passed out she left six children, &quot;all of a size,&quot;
a neighbor woman has written. Over her grave is a
tablet erected by her husband informing the wayfarer
that &quot;she has gone to meet her Savior.&quot; At the bottom
is this warning to all women: &quot;Be ye also ready; for
in such an hour as ye think not the Son of Man cometh.&quot;</p>

<p>Five of these motherless children were girls and one
a boy.</p>

<p>As you stand there in that stone church at
Haworth reading the inscription above Maria Branwell's
grave, you can also read the death record of the
babes she left. The mother died on September Fifteenth,
Eighteen Hundred Twenty-one; her oldest daughter,
Maria, on May Sixth, Eighteen Hundred Twenty-five;
Elizabeth, June Fifteenth, Eighteen Hundred
Twenty-five; Patrick Branwell, on September Twenty-fourth,
Eighteen Hundred Forty-eight; Emily, December
Nineteenth, Eighteen Hundred Forty-eight; Anne,
May Twenty-eighth, Eighteen Hundred Forty-nine;
and Charlotte, on March Thirty-first, Eighteen Hundred
Fifty-five. Those whom the gods love die young: the
Reverend Patrick Bronte lived to be eighty-five years old.</p>
<p><a name="II_Page_106"></a></p>
<hr />
<p>I got out of the train at Keighley, which you
must pronounce &quot;Keethley,&quot; and leaving
my valise with the station-master started on
foot for Haworth, four miles away.</p>

<p>Keighley is a manufacturing town where various old
mansions have been turned into factories, and new
factories have sprung up, square, spick-span, trimmed-stone
buildings, with fire-escapes and red tanks on top.</p>

<p>One of these old mansions I saw had a fine copper roof
that shone in the sun like a monster Lake Superior
agate. It stands a bit back from the road, and on one
great gatepost is a brass plate reading &quot;Cardigan Hall,&quot;
and on the other a sign, &quot;No Admittance&mdash;Apply at
the Office.&quot; So I applied at the office, which is evidently
the ancient lodge, and asked if Mr. Cardigan was in.
Four clerks perched on high stools, crouching over big
ledgers, dropped their pens and turning on their spiral
seats looked at me with staring eyes, and with mouths
wide open. I repeated the question and one of the
quartette, a wheezy little old man in spectacles and
with whiskers on his neck, clambered down from his
elevated position and ambled over near, walking around
me, eying me curiously.</p>

<p>&quot;Go wan wi' yer wurruk, ye idlers!&quot; he suddenly commanded
the others. And then he explained to me that
Mr. Cardigan was not in, neither was Mr. Jackson. In
fact, Mr. Cardigan had not been in for a hundred years&mdash;being
dead. But if I wanted to look at goods I could
<a name="II_Page_107"></a>be accommodated with bargains fully five per cent
below Lunnon market. The little old man was in such
serious earnest that I felt it would be a sin to continue
a joke. I explained that I was only a tourist in search of
the picturesque, and thereby did I drop ten points in
the old man's estimation. But this did I learn, that
Lord Cardigan has won deathless fame by attaching his
name to a knit jacket, just as the name Jaeger will go
clattering down the corridors of time attached to a
&quot;combination suit.&quot;</p>

<p>This splendid old mansion was once the ancestral home
of a branch of the noble family of Cardigan. But things
got somewhat shuffled, through too many hot suppers
up to London (being south), and stacks of reds and
stacks of blues were drawn in towards the dealer, and so
the old mansion fell under the hammer of the auctioneer.
What an all-powerful thing is an auctioneer's hammer!
And now from the great parlors, and the library, and the
&quot;hall,&quot; and the guest-chambers echo the rattle of
spinning-jennies and the dull booming of whirling
pulleys. And above the song of whirring wheels came
the songs of girls at their work&mdash;voices that alone might
have been harsh and discordant, but blending with the
monotone of the factory's roar were really melodious.</p>

<p>&quot;We cawn't keep the nasty things from singin',&quot;
said the old man apologetically.</p>

<p>&quot;Why should you?&quot; I asked.</p>

<p>&quot;Huh, mon! but they sing sacred songs, and chaunts,
<a name="II_Page_108"></a>and a' that, and say all together from twenty rooms, a
hundred times a day, 'Aws ut wuz in th' beginnin,' uz
now awn ever shawl be, worl' wi'out end, Aamen.' It's
not right. I've told Mr. Jackson. Listen now, didn't
I tell ye?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Then you are a Churchman?&quot;</p>

<p>And the old man wiped his glasses and told me that he
was a Churchman, although an unworthy one, and had
been for fifty-four years, come Michaelmas. Yes, he had
always lived here, was born only across the beck away&mdash;his
father was gamekeeper for Lord Cardigan, and
afterwards agent. He had been to Haworth many times,
although not for ten years. He knew the Reverend
Patrick Bronte well, for the Incumbent from Haworth
used to preach at Keighley once a year, and sometimes
twice. Bronte was a fine man, with a splendid voice for
intoning, and very strict about keeping out all heresies
and such. He had a lot of trouble, had Bronte: his wife
died and left him with eight or ten children, all smart,
but rather wild. They gave him a lot of bother, especially
the boy. One of the girls married Mr. Bronte's
curate, Mr. Nicholls, a very decent kind of man who
comes to Keighley once a year, and always comes to the
factory to ask how things are going.</p>

<p>Yes, Mr. Nicholls' first wife died years and years ago.
She used to write things&mdash;novels; but no one should read
novels; novels are stories that are not so&mdash;things that
never happened; they tell of folks that never was.</p>

<p><a name="II_Page_109"></a>Having no argument to present in way of rebuttal, I
shook hands with the old man and started away. He
walked with me to the road to put me on the right way
to Haworth.</p>

<p>Looking back as I reached the corner, I saw four
&quot;clarks&quot; watching me intently from the office windows,
and above the roar and jangle of machinery was borne
on the summer breeze the sound of sacred song&mdash;shrill
feminine voices:</p>

<p>&quot;Aws ut wuz in th' beginnin', uz now awn ever shawl
be, worl' wi'out end&mdash;Aamen!&quot;</p>
<p><a name="II_Page_110"></a></p>
<hr />

<p>As one moves out of Keighley the country
becomes stony; the trees are left behind, and
there rises on all sides billow on billow of
purple heather. The way is rough as the
Pilgrim's Progress road to Paradise. These hillside moors
are filled with springs that high up form rills, then
brooks, then cascades or &quot;becks,&quot; and along the
Haworth road, wherever one of these hurrying, scurrying,
dancing becks crosses the highway, there is a factory
devoted to keeping alive the name of Cardigan. Next
to the factory is a &quot;pub.,&quot; and publics and factories
checker themselves all along the route. Mixed in with
these are long rows of tenement-houses well built of
stone, with slate roofs, but with a grimy air of desolation
about them that surely drives their occupants to
drink. To have a home a man must build it himself.
Forty houses in a row, all alike, are not homes at all.</p>

<p>I believe an observant man once wrote of the hand being
subdued to what it works in. The man who wrote that
surely never tramped along the Haworth road as the
bell rang for twelve o'clock. From out the factories
poured a motley mob of men, women and children, not
only with hands dyed, but with clothing, faces and heads
as well. Girls with bright-green hair, and lemon-colored
faces, leered and jeered at me as they hastened pellmell
with hats askew, and stockings down, and dragging
shawls, for home or public-house. Red and maroon
children ran, and bright-scarlet men smoked stolidly,
<a name="II_Page_111"></a>taking their time with genuine grim Yorkshire sullen
sourness.</p>

<p>&quot;How far is it to Haworth?&quot; I asked one such specimen.</p>

<p>&quot;Ef ye pay th' siller for a double pot a' 'arf and 'arf.
Hi might tell ye&quot;; and he jerked his thumb over his
shoulder toward a ginshop near by.</p>

<p>&quot;Very well,&quot; said I; &quot;I'll buy you a double pot of
'arf and 'arf, this time.&quot;</p>

<p>The man seemed a bit surprised, but no smile came over
his spattered rainbow face as he led the way into the
drink-shop. The place was crowded with men and women
scrambling for penny sandwiches and drinks fermented
and spirituous. Some of these women had babies at their
breasts, the babies being brought by appointment by
older children who stayed at home while the mothers
worked. And as the mothers gulped their Triple XXX,
and swallowed hunks of black bread, the little innocents
dined. The mothers were rather kindly disposed, though,
and occasionally allowed the youngsters to take sips out
of their foaming glasses, or at least to drain them.
Suddenly a woman with purple hair spied me and called
in falsetto:</p>

<p>&quot;Ah, Sawndy McClure has caught a gen'l'mon. Why
didn't I see 'im fust an' 'arve 'im fer a pet?&quot;</p>

<p>There was a guffaw at my expense and 'arf and 'arf as
well, for all the party, or else quarrel. As it was, my
stout stick probably saved me from the &quot;personal
touch.&quot; I stayed until the factory-bells rang, and out
<a name="II_Page_112"></a>my new-found friends scurried for fear of being the fatal
five minutes late and getting locked out. Some of them
shook my hand as they went, and others pounded me
on the back for luck, and several of the girls got my
tag and shouted, &quot;You're it!&quot;</p>

<p>I used to think that Yorkshire folks were hopelessly
dull and sublimely stupid, quarrelsome withal and pigheaded
to the thirty-second degree; but I have partially
come to the conclusion that their glum ways often
conceal a peculiar kind of grim humor, and beneath the
tough husk is considerable good nature.</p>

<p>The absence of large trees makes it possible to see the
village of Haworth several miles away. It seems to cling
to the stony hillside as if it feared being blown into
space. There is a hurrying, rushing rill here, too, that
turns a little woolen-mill. Then there is a &quot;Black Bull&quot;
tavern, with a stable-yard at the side and rows of
houses on the one street, all very straight up and down.
One misses the climbing roses of the ideal merry England,
and the soft turf and spreading yews and the
flowering hedgerows where throstles and linnets play
hide-and-seek the livelong day. It is all cold gray stone,
lichen-covered, and the houses do not invite you to
enter, and the gardens bid no welcome, and only the
great purple wastes of moorland greet you as a friend
and brother.</p>

<p>Outside the Black Bull sits a solitary hostler, who feels it
would be a weakness to show any good humor. So he
<a name="II_Page_113"></a>bottles his curiosity and scowls from under red, bushy
eyebrows.</p>

<p>Turning off the main street is a narrow road leading to
the church&mdash;square and gray and cold. Next to it is the
parsonage, built of the same material, and beyond is the
crowded city of the dead.</p>

<p>I plied the knocker at the parsonage door and asked for
the rector. He was away at Kendal to attend a funeral,
but his wife was at home&mdash;a pleasant, matronly woman
of near sixty, with smooth, white hair. She came to the
door knitting furiously, but from her regulation smile I
saw that visitors were not uncommon.</p>

<p>&quot;You want to see the home of the Brontes? That's
right, come right in. This was the study of the Reverend
Patrick Bronte, Incumbent of this Parish for fifty years.&quot;</p>

<p>She sang her little song and knitted and shifted the
needles and measured the foot, for the stocking was
nearly done. It was a blue stocking (although she
wasn't) with a white toe; and all the time she led me
from room to room telling me about the Brontes&mdash;how
there were the father, mother and six children. They
all came together. The mother died shortly, and then
two of the little girls died. That left three girls and
Branwell the boy. He was petted and made too much of
by his father and everybody. He was the one that always
was going to do great things. He made the girls wait
on him and cuffed them if they didn't, and if they did,
and all the time told of the things he was going to do.
<a name="II_Page_114"></a>But he never did them, for he spent most of his time at
the taverns. After a while he died&mdash;died of the tremens.</p>

<p>The three Bronte girls, Emily, Charlotte and Annie,
wrote a novel apiece, and never showed them to their
father or to any one. They called 'emselves Currer,
Ellis and Acton Bell, and their novels were the greatest
ever written&mdash;they wrote them 'emselves with no man
to help. Their father was awful mad about it, but when
the money began to come in he felt better. Emily died
when she was twenty-seven. She was the brightest of
them all; then Annie died, and only Charlotte and the
old man were left. Charlotte married her father's curate,
but old Mr. Bronte wouldn't go to the wedding: he
went to the Black Bull instead. Miss Wooler gave the
bride away&mdash;some one had to give her away, you
know. The bride was thirty-eight. She died in less them
a year, and old Mr. Bronte and Charlotte's husband
lived here alone together.</p>

<p>This was Charlotte's room; this is the desk where she
wrote &quot;Jane Eyre&quot;&mdash;leastwise they say it is. This is
the chair she sat in, and under that framed glass are
several sheets of her manuscript. The writing is almost
too small to read; and so fine and yet so perfect and
neat! She was a wonderful tidy body, very small and
delicate and gentle, yet with a good deal of her father's
energy.</p>

<p>Here are letters she wrote: you can look at them if you
choose. This footstool she made and covered herself.
<a name="II_Page_115"></a>It is filled with heather-blossoms&mdash;just as she left it.
Those books were hers, too&mdash;many of them given to her
by great authors. See, there is Thackeray's name
written by himself, and a letter from him pasted inside
the front cover. He was a big man they say, but he
wrote very small, and Charlotte wrote just like him,
only better, and now there are hundreds of folks write
like 'em both. Then here's a book with Miss Martineau's
name, and another from Robert Browning&mdash;do
you know who he was?</p>

<p>Yes, the church is always open. Go in and stay as long
as you choose; at the door is a poorbox and if you wish
to put something in you can do so&mdash;a sixpence most
visitors put in, or a shilling if you insist upon it. You
know we are not a rich parish&mdash;the wool all goes to
Manchester now, and the factory-hands are on half-pay
and times are scarce. You will come again some
time, come when the heather is in bloom, won't you?
That's right. Oh, stay! the boxwood there in the garden
was planted by Charlotte's own hands&mdash;perhaps you
would like a sprig of it&mdash;there, I thought you would!</p>
<p><a name="II_Page_116"></a></p>
<hr />

<p>All who write concerning the Brontes dwell
on the sadness and the tragedy of their lives.
They picture Charlotte's earth-journey as
one devoid of happiness, lacking all that
sweetens and makes for satisfaction. They forget that
she wrote &quot;Jane Eyre,&quot; and that no person utterly
miserable ever did a great work; and I assume that they
know not of the wild, splendid, intoxicating joy that
follows a performance well done. To be sure, &quot;Jane
Eyre&quot; is a tragedy, but the author of a tragedy must
be greater than the plot&mdash;greater than his puppets. He
is their creator, and his life runs through and pervades
theirs, just as the life of our Creator flows through us.
In Him we live and move and have our being. And I
submit that the writer of a tragedy is not cast down or
undone at the time he pictures his heroic situations
and conjures forth his strutting spirits. When the play
ends and the curtain falls on the fifth act, there is still
one man alive, and that is the author. He may be
gorged with crime and surfeited with blood, but there
is a surging exultation in his veins as he views the ruin
that his brain has wrought.</p>

<p>Charlotte loved the great stretch of purple moors, hill
on hill fading away into eternal mist. And the wild
winds that sighed and moaned at casements or raged
in sullen wrath, tugging at the roof, were her friends.
She loved them all, and thought of them as visiting
spirits. They were her properties, and no writer who
<a name="II_Page_117"></a>ever lived has made such splendid use of winds and
storm-clouds and driving rain as did Charlotte Bronte.
People who point to the chasing, angry clouds and the
swish of dripping rosebushes blown against the cottage-windows
as proof of Charlotte Bronte's chronic depression
know not the eager joy of a storm walk. And I am
sure they never did as one I know did last night: saddle
a horse at ten o'clock and gallop away into the darkness;
splash, splash in the sighing, moaning, bellowing,
driving November rain. There's joy for you! ye who
toast your feet on the fender and cultivate sick headache
around the base-burner&mdash;there's a life that ye
never guess!</p>

<p>But Charlotte knew the clouds by night and the swift-sailing
moon that gave just one peep out and disappeared.
She knew the rifts where the stars shone through,
and out alone in the breeze that blew away her cares
she lifted her voice in thankfulness for the joy of mixing
with the elements, and that her spirit was one with the
boisterous winds of heaven.</p>

<p>People who live in beautiful, quiet valleys, where roses
bloom all the year through, are not necessarily happy.</p>

<p>Southern California&mdash;the Garden of Eden of the world&mdash;evolves
just as many cases per capita of melancholia
as bleak, barren Maine. Wild, rocky, forbidding Scotland
has produced more genius to the acre than beautiful
England: and I have found that sailor Jack, facing
the North Atlantic winter storms, year after year, is a
<a name="II_Page_118"></a>deal jollier companion than the Florida cracker whose
chief adversary is the mosquito.</p>

<p>Charlotte Bronte wrote three great books: &quot;Jane
Eyre,&quot; &quot;Shirley&quot; and &quot;Villette.&quot; From the lonely,
bleak parsonage on that stony hillside she sent forth
her swaying filament of thought and lassoed the world.
She lived to know that she had won. Money came to
her, all she needed, honors, friends and lavish praise.
She was the foremost woman author of her day. Her
name was on every tongue. She had met the world in
fair fight; without patrons, paid advocates, or influential
friends she made her way to the very front. Her genius
was acknowledged. She accomplished all that she set
out to do and more&mdash;far more. The great, the learned,
the titled, the proud&mdash;all those who reverence the tender
heart and far-reaching mind&mdash;acknowledged her as
queen.</p>

<p>So why prate of her sorrows! Did she not work them up
into art? Why weep over her troubles when these were
the weapons with which she won? Why sit in sackcloth
on account of her early death, when it is appointed
unto all men once to die, and with her the grave was
swallowed up in victory?</p>

<p>As a study in heredity, the Rossetti
family is most interesting. Genius
seems so sporadic a stuff that when
we find an outcrop along the line of
a whole family we are wont to mark
it on memory's chart in red. We
talk of the Herschels, of Renan and
his sister, of the Beechers, and the
Fields, in a sort of awe, mindful that Nature is parsimonious
in giving out transcendent talent, and may
never do the like again. So who can forget the Rossettis&mdash;two
brothers, Dante Gabriel and William Michael,
and two sisters, Maria and Christina&mdash;each of whom
stands forth as far above the ordinary, yet all strangely
dependent upon one another?</p>

<p>The girls sing songs to the brothers, and to each other,
inscribing poems to &quot;my loving sister&quot;; when Dante
Gabriel, budding forth as artist, wishes a model for a
Madonna, he chooses his sister Christina, and in his
sketch mantles the plain features with a divine gentleness
and heavenly splendor such as only the loving heart
can conjure forth. In the last illness of Maria, Christina
watches away the long, lagging hours of night, almost
striving with her brothers for the right of serving; and
at Birchington-on-the-Sea, Dante Gabriel waits for
death, wearing out his friends by insane suspicions, and
<a name="II_Page_124"></a>only the sister seems equal to ministering to this mind
diseased, plucking from memory its rooted sorrow.</p>

<p>In a few years Christina passes out, and of the four,
only William is left; and the task of his remaining years
is to put properly before the world the deathless lives of
his brother and sisters gone.</p>

<p>Gabriel Rossetti, father of the illustrious four, was an
Italian poet who wrote patriotic hymns, and wrote them
so well that he was asked to sing them elsewhere than in
Italy. This edict of banishment was followed by an
order that the poet be arrested and executed.</p>

<p>The orders of banishment and execution appear quite
Milesian viewed across the years, but to Rossetti it
was no joke. To keep his head in its proper place and
to preserve his soul alive, he departed one dark night
for England. He arrived penniless, with no luggage save
his lyre, but with muse intact. Yet it was an Italian
lyre, and therefore of small avail for amusing Britons.
Very naturally, Rossetti made the acquaintance of
other refugees, and exile makes fast friends. It is only
in prosperity that we throw our friends overboard.</p>

<p>He came to know the Polidori family&mdash;Tuscan refugees&mdash;proud,
intellectual and rich. He loved one of the
daughters of Seignior Polidori, and she loved him. He
was forty and she was twenty-three&mdash;but what of that!
A position as Professor of Languages was secured for
him in King's College. He rented the house at Thirty-eight
Charlotte Street, off Portland Place, and there,
<a name="II_Page_125"></a>on February Seventeenth, Eighteen Hundred Twenty-seven,
was born their first child, Maria Francesca; on
May Twelfth, Eighteen Hundred Twenty-eight, was
born Dante Gabriel; on September Twenty-fifth, Eighteen
Hundred Twenty-nine, William Michael; on
December Fifth, Eighteen Hundred Thirty, Christina
Georgiana. The mother of this quartette was a sturdy
little woman with sparkling wit and rare good sense.
She used to remark that her children were all of a
size, and that it was no more trouble to bring up four
than one, a suggestion thrown in here gratis for the
benefit of young married folks, in the hope that they
will mark and inwardly digest. In point of well-ballasted,
all-round character, fit for Earth or Heaven, none of
the four Rossetti children was equal to his parents.
They all seem to have had nerves outside of their
clothes. Perhaps this was because they were brought
up in London. A city is no place for children&mdash;nor
grown people either, I often think. Birds and children
belong in the country. Paved streets, stone sidewalks,
smoke-begrimed houses, signs reading, &quot;Keep Off
the Grass&quot;, prying policemen, and zealous ash-box
inspectors are insulting things to greet the gaze of the
little immigrants fresh from God. Small wonder is it,
as they grow up, that they take to drink and drugs, seeking
in these a respite from the rattle of wheels and the
never-ending cramp of unkind condition. But Nature
understands herself: the second generation, city-bred,
<a name="II_Page_126"></a>is impotent.</p>

<p>No pilgrim from &quot;the States&quot; should
visit the city of London without carrying two books:
a Baedeker's &quot;London&quot; and Hutton's &quot;Literary
Landmarks.&quot; The chief advantage of the former is
that it is bound in flaming red, and carried in the hand,
advertises the owner as an American, thus saving all
formal introductions. In the rustle, bustle and tussle
of Fleet Street, I have held up my book to a party of
Americans on the opposite sidewalk, as a ship runs up
her colors, and they, seeing the sign, in turn held up
theirs in merry greeting; and we passed on our way
without a word, ships that pass in the afternoon and
greet each other in passing. Now, I have no desire to
rival the flamboyant Baedeker, nor to eclipse my good
friend Laurence Hutton. But as I can not find that
either mentions the name &quot;Rossetti,&quot; I am going to
set down (not in malice) the places in London that
are closely connected with the Rossetti family, nothing
extenuating.</p>

<p>London is the finest city in the world for the tourist
who desires liberty as wide as the wind, and who
wishes to live cheaply and live well. In New York, if
you want lodgings at a moderate price, you must
throttle your pride and forsake respectability; but
they do things different in Lunnon, you know. From
Gray's Inn Road to Portland Place, and from Oxford
Street to Euston Road, there is just about a square
mile&mdash;a section, as they say out West&mdash;of lodging-<a name="II_Page_127"></a>houses.
Once this part of London was given up to the
homes of the great and purse-proud and all that. It is
respectable yet, and if you are going to be in London
a week you can get a good room in one of these old-time
mansions, and pay no more for it than you would
pay for a room in an American hotel for one day. And
as for meals, your landlady will get you anything you
want and serve it for you in the daintiest style, and
you will also find that a shilling and a little courtesy
will go a very long way in securing creature comforts.
American women in London can live in this way just
as well as men. If you are a schoolma'am from Peoria,
taking your vacation, follow my advice and make
your home in the &quot;Bedford District,&quot; within easy
reach of Stopford Brooke's chapel, and your London
visit will stand out forever as a bright oasis in memory's
desert waste. All of which I put in here because Larry
Hutton forgot to mention it and Mein Herr Baedeker
didn't think it worth while.</p>

<p>When in London I usually get a room near the British
Museum for ten shillings a week; and when I want to
go anywhere I walk up to the Gower Street Station,
past the house where the mother of Charles Dickens
had her Young Ladies' Establishment, and buying a
ticket at the &quot;Booking-Office&quot; am duly set down near
the desired objective point. You can go anywhere by
the &quot;Metropolitan,&quot; or if you prefer to take Mr. Gladstone's
advice, you climb to the top of an Oxford
<a name="II_Page_128"></a>Street bus, and if you sit next the driver you have a
directory, guide and familiar friend all at your service.</p>

<p>Charlotte Street is a narrow little passage running
just two squares, parallel with Portland Place. The
houses are built in blocks of five (or more), of the
plainest of plain bricks. The location is not far from
the Gower Street Station of the Metropolitan Railway,
and only a few minutes' walk from the British Museum.
Number Thirty-eight is the last but one on the east
side of the street. When I first saw it, there was a sign
in the window, &quot;Apartments,&quot; and back of this fresh
cambric curtains. Then the window had been cleaned,
too, for a single day of neglect in London tells its tale,
as does the record of crime on a rogue's face. I paused
and looked the place over with interest. I noted that
the brass plate with the &quot;No. 38&quot; on it had been
polished until it had been nearly polished out of sight,
like a machine-made sonnet too much gone over. The
steps had been freshly sanded, and a little lemon-tree
nodding in one of the windows made the rusty old
house look quite inviting. A stout little woman with
a big market-basket, bumped into me and apologized,
for I had stepped backwards to get a better look at
the upstairs windows. The stout little woman set
down her basket on the steps, took a bunch of keys
from a pocket under her big, white, starched apron,
selected one, turned to me, smiled, and asked, &quot;Mebbe,
Sir, you wasn't looking for apartments, I dunno?&quot;
<a name="II_Page_129"></a>Then she explained that the house was hers, and that
if I would step in she would show me the rooms. There
were two of 'em she could spare. The first floor front
was already let, and so was the front parlor&mdash;to a
young barrister. Her husband was a ticket-taker at
Euston Station, and didn't get much since last cutdown.
Would I care to pay as much as ten shillings,
and would I want breakfast? It would only be ninepence,
and I could have either a chop or ham and eggs.
She looked after her boarders herself, just as if they
were her own folks, and only took respectable single
gentlemen who came well recommended. She knew I
would like the room, and if ten shillings was too much
I could have the back room for seven and six.</p>

<p>I thought the back room would answer; but explained
that I was an American and was going to remain in
London only a short time. Of course the lady knew I
was an American: she knew it from my hat and from
my foreign accent and&mdash;from the red book I had in
my hand. And did I know the McIntyres that lived
in Michigan?</p>

<p>I evaded the question by asking if she knew the Rossettis
who once lived in this house. &quot;Oh, yes; I know
Mr. William and Miss Christina. They came here
together a year ago, and told me they were born here
and that their brother Dante and their sister, too,
were born here. I think they were all writin' folks,
weren't they? Miss Rossetti anyway writes poetry,
<a name="II_Page_130"></a>I know that. One of my boarders gave me one of her
books for Christmas. I'll show it to you. You don't
think seven and six is too much for a room like this,
do you?&quot;</p>

<p>I inwardly noted that the ceilings were much lower
than those of my room in Russell Square and that the
furniture was old and worn and that the room looked
out on an army of sooty chimney-pots, but I explained
that seven and six seemed a very reasonable price, and
that ninepence for breakfast with ham and eggs was
cheap enough, provided the eggs were strictly fresh.</p>

<p>So I paid one week's rent in advance on the spot,
and going back to Russell Square told my landlady
that I had found friends in another part of the city
and would not return for two days. My sojourn at
Number Thirty-eight Charlotte Street developed nothing
further than the meager satisfaction of sleeping
for two nights in the room in which Dante Gabriel
Rossetti was born, and making the acquaintance of the
worthy ticket-taker, who knew all four of the Rossettis,
as they had often passed through his gate.</p>

<p>Professor Rossetti lived for twelve years at Thirty-eight
Charlotte Street; he then moved to Number Fifty
in the next block, which is a somewhat larger house.
It was here that Mazzini used to come. The house had
been made over somewhat, and is now used as an
office by the Registrar of Vital Statistics. This is the
place where Dante Gabriel and a young man named
<a name="II_Page_131"></a>Holman Hunt had a studio, and where another young
artist by the name of William Morris came to visit
them; and here was born &quot;The Germ,&quot; that queer
little chipmunk magazine in which first appeared
&quot;Hand and Soul&quot; and &quot;The Blessed Damozel,&quot;
written by Dante Gabriel when eighteen, the same
age at which Bryant wrote &quot;Thanatopsis.&quot; William
Bell Scott used to come here, too. Scott was a great
man in his day. He had no hair on his head or face,
not even eyebrows. Every follicle had grown aweary
and quit. But Mr. Scott was quite vain of the shape
of his head, for well he might be, since several choice
sonnets had been combed out of it. Sometimes when
the wine went round and things grew merry, then
sentimental, then confidential, Scott would snatch off
his wig to display to the company his fine phrenological
development, and tell a story about Nelson, who, too,
used to wear a wig just like his, and after every battle
would take it off and hand it over to his valet to have
the bullets combed out of it.</p>

<p>The elder Rossetti died in this house, and was carried
to Christ Church in Woburn Square, and thence to
Highgate. His excellent wife waited to see the genius
of her children blossom and be acknowledged. She followed
thirty years later, and was buried in the same
grave with her husband, where, later, Christina was
to join them.</p>

<p>Frances Mary Polidori was born at Forty-two Broad
<a name="II_Page_132"></a>Street, Golden Square, the same street in which William
Blake was born. I found the street and Golden
Square, but could not locate the house. The policeman
on the beat declared that no one by the name of Rossetti
or Blake was in business thereabouts; and further
he never heard of Polly Dory. William Michael Rossetti's
home is one in a row of houses called Saint
Edmund's Terrace. It is near the Saint John's Road
Station, just a step from Regent's Park, and faces the
Middlesex Waterworks. It is a fine old house, built
of stone I should judge, stuccoed on the outside. With
a well-known critic I called there, and found the master
wearing a long dressing-gown that came to his
heels, a pair of new carpet slippers and a black plush
cap, all so dusty that we guessed the owner had been
sifting ashes in the cellar. He was most courteous and
polite. He worships at the shrine of Whitman, Emerson
and Thoreau, and regards America as the spot from
whence must come the world's intellectual hope.
&quot;Great thoughts, like beautiful flowers, are produced
by transplantation and the commingling of many
elements.&quot; These are his words, and the fact that the
Rossetti genius is the result of transplanting need not
weigh in the scale as 'gainst the truth of the remark.
Shortly after this call, at an Art Exhibition, I again
met William Michael Rossetti. I talked with him some
moments&mdash;long enough to discover that he was not
aware we had ever met. This caused me to be rather
<a name="II_Page_133"></a>less in love with the Rossetti genius than I was before.</p>

<p>The wife of Dante Gabriel Rossetti died, aged
twenty-nine, at Fourteen Chatham Place, near Blackfriars
Bridge. The region thereabouts has been changed
by the march of commerce, and if the original house
where the artist lived yet stands I could not find it.
It was here that the Preraphaelites made history: Madox
Brown, Burne-Jones, Ruskin, William Morris and the
MacDonalds. Burne-Jones married one of the MacDonald
daughters; Mr. Poynter, now Director of the
National Gallery, another; Mr. Kipling still another&mdash;with
Rudyard Kipling as a result, followed in due
course by Mulvaney, Ortheris and Learoyd, who are
quite as immortal as the rest.</p>

<p>At this time Professor Rossetti was dead, and William
Michael, Maria, Christina and the widowed mother
were living at One Hundred Sixty-six Albany Street,
fighting off various hungry wolves that crouched
around the door. Albany Street is rather shabby now,
and was then, I suppose. At One Hundred Twelve
Albany Street lives one Dixon, who takes marvelous
photographs of animals in the Zoological Gardens,
with a pocket camera, and then enlarges the pictures
a hundred times. These pictures go the round world
over and command big prices. Mr. Dixon was taking
for me, at the National Gallery, the negatives from
which I made photogravures for my Ruskin-Turner
book. Mr. Dixon knows more in an artistic and literary
<a name="II_Page_134"></a>way than any other man in London (I believe), but
he is a modest gentleman and only emits his facts under
cross-examination or under the spell of inspiration.
Together we visited the house at One Hundred Sixty-six
Albany Street.</p>

<p>It was vacant at the time, and we rummaged through
every room, with the result that we concluded it makes
very little difference where genius is housed. On one
of the windows of a little bedroom we found the word
&quot;Christina&quot; cut with a diamond. When and by whom
it was done I do not know. Surely the Rossettis had
no diamonds when they lived here. But Mr. Dixon had
a diamond and with his ring he cut beneath the word
just noted the name, &quot;Dante Gabriel Rossetti.&quot; I have
recently heard that the signature has been identified
as authentic by a man who was familiar with Rossetti's
handwriting.</p>

<p>When the firm of Morris and Company, Dealers in
Art Fabrics, was gotten under way, and Dante Gabriel
had ceased to argue details with that pre-eminently
sane man, William Morris, his finances began to prosper.
Morris directed and utilized the energies of his
partners. He marshaled their virtues into a solid phalanx
and marched them on to victory. No doubt that
genius usually requires a keeper. But Morris was a
genius himself and a giant in more ways than one, for
he ruled his own spirit, thus proving himself greater
than one who taketh a city.</p>
<p><a name="II_Page_135"></a></p>
<p>In Eighteen Hundred Sixty-two, we find Dante Gabriel
throwing out the fact that his income was equal to
about ten thousand dollars a year. He took the beautiful
house at Eighteen Cheyne Walk, Chelsea, near the
little street where lived a Scotchman by the name of
Thomas Carlyle, and in the same block where afterwards
lived George Eliot, and where she died. He
wanted his brother and sisters and his mother to
share his prosperity, and so he planned that they
should all come and live with him; and besides, Mr.
Swinburne and George Meredith were to come, too.
It was to be one big happy family. But the good old
mother knew the human heart better than did her
brilliant son. She has left on record these words: &quot;Yes,
my children all have talent, great talent; I only wish
they had a little commonsense!&quot;</p>

<p>So for the present she remained with William, her
daughters, and her two aged unmarried sisters in the
plain old house in Albany Street. But Dante Gabriel
moved to Cheyne Walk, and began that craze for
collecting blue china that has swept like a blight over
the civilized world. His collection was sold for three
thousand five hundred dollars some years after&mdash;to pay
his debts&mdash;less than one-half of what it had cost him.
Yet when he had money he generously divided it with
the folks up in Albany Street. But by and by William,
too, got to making money, and the quarters at Number
One Hundred Sixty-six were abandoned for something
<a name="II_Page_136"></a>better.</p>

<p>William was married and had taken a house
of his own&mdash;I don't know where. The rest of the household
consisted of the widow, Mrs. Rossetti, Miss Charlotte
Lydia Polidori, Maria and Christina&mdash;and seven
cats. And so we find this family of five women living
in peace and comfort, with their books and pictures
and cats, at Thirty Torrington Square, in a drowsy,
faded, ebb-tide mansion. Maria was never strong; she
fell into a decline and passed away. The management
of the household then devolved on Christina. Her
burdens must have been heavy in those days, or did she
make them light by cheerful doing? She gave up
society, refused the thought of marriage, and joined
that unorganized sisterhood of mercy&mdash;the women
who toil that others may live. But she sang at her
work, as the womanly woman ever does. For although
a woman may hold no babe in her arms, the lullaby
leaps to her tongue, and at eventide she sings songs
to the children of her brain&mdash;sweet idealization of the
principle of mother-love.</p>

<p>Christina Rossetti comes to us as one of those splendid
stars that are so far away they are seen only at rare
intervals. She never posed as a &quot;literary person&quot;&mdash;reading
her productions at four-o'clocks, and winning
high praise from the unbonneted and the discerning
society editor. She never even sought a publisher. Her
first volume of verses was issued by her grandfather
Polidori unknown to her&mdash;printed by his own labor
<a name="II_Page_137"></a>when she was seventeen and presented to her. What a
surprise it must have been to this gentle girl to have
one of her own books placed in her hands! There seems
to have been an almost holy love in this proud man's
heart for his granddaughter. His love was blind, or
near-sighted at least, as love is apt to be (and I am
glad!), for some of the poems in this little volume are
sorry stuff. Later, her brothers issued her work and
found market for it; and once we find Dante Gabriel
almost quarreling with that worthy Manxman, Hall
Caine, because the Manxman was compiling a volume
of the best English sonnets and threatening to leave
Christina Rossetti out.</p>

<p>Christina had the faculty of seizing beautiful moments,
exalted feelings, sublime emotions, and working them
up into limpid song that comes echoing to us as from
across soft seas. In all her lines there is a half-sobbing
undertone&mdash;the sweet minor chord that is ever present
in the songs of the Choir Invisible, whose music is the
gladness as well as the sadness of the world.</p>

<p>I have a dear friend who is an amateur photographic
artist, which be it known is quite a different thing
from a kodak fiend. The latter is continually snapping
a machine at incongruous things; he delights in catching
people in absurd postures; he pictures the foolish,
the irrelevant, the transient and the needless. But
what does my friend picture? I'll tell you. He catches
pictures only of beautiful objects: swaying stalks of
<a name="II_Page_138"></a>goldenrod, flights of thistle-down, lichen on old stone
walls, barks of trees, oak-leaves, bunches of acorns,
single sprays of apple-blossoms. Last Spring he found
two robins building a nest in a cherry-tree: he placed
his camera near them, and attaching a fine wire to
spring the shutter, took a picture of Mr. and Mrs.
Robin Redbreast laying down the first coarse straws
for their nest. Then he took a picture every day for
thirty days of that nest&mdash;from the time four blue eggs
are shown until four, wide-open mouths are held hungrily
for dainty grubs. This series of photographs forms
an Epic of Creation. So, if you ask me to solve the question
of whether photography is art, I'll answer: it all
depends upon what you picture, and how you present it.</p>

<p>Christina Rossetti focused her thought on the beautiful
object and at the best angle, so the picture she
brings us is nobly ordered and richly suggestive.</p>

<p>And so the days passed in study, writing, housework,
and caring for old ladies three. Dante Gabriel, talented,
lovable, erratic, had gotten into bad ways, as a man
will who turns night into day and tries to get the start
of God Almighty, thinking he has found a substitute
for exercise and oxygen. Finally he was taken to Birchington,
on the Isle of Thanet (where Octave found her
name). He was mentally ill, to a point where he had
through his delusions driven away all his old-time
friends.</p>

<p>Christina, aged fifty-one, and the mother,
aged eighty-two, went to take care of him, and they
<a name="II_Page_139"></a>did for him with all the loving tenderness what they
might have done for a sick baby; but with this difference&mdash;they
had to fight his strength. Yet still there
were times when his mind was sweet and gentle as in
the days of old; and toward the last these periods of
restful peace increased, and there were hours when the
brother, sister and aged mother held sweet converse,
almost as when children they were taught at this
mother's knee. Dante Gabriel Rossetti died April
Ninth, Eighteen Hundred Ninety-two. His grave is in
the old country churchyard at Birchington.</p>

<p>Two years afterward the mother passed out; in Eighteen
Hundred Ninety, Eliza Polidori died, aged eighty-seven;
and in Eighteen Hundred Ninety-three, her
sister Charlotte joined her, aged eighty-four. In Christ's
Church, Woburn Square, you can see memorial tablets
to these fine souls, and if you get acquainted with the
gentle old rector he will show you a pendant star and
crescent, set with diamonds, given by the Sultan during
the Crimean war, &quot;To Miss Charlotte Lydia Polidori
for distinguished services as Nurse.&quot; And he will
also show you a silver communion set marked with the
names of these three sisters, followed by that of &quot;Christina
Georgiana Rossetti.&quot;</p>

<p>And so they all went to their soul's rest and left Christina
alone in the big house with its echoing halls&mdash;too
big by half for its lonely, simple-hearted mistress and
her pets. She felt that her work was done, and feeling
<a name="II_Page_140"></a>so, the end soon came. She died December Twenty-ninth,
Eighteen Hundred Ninety-four&mdash;passing from
a world that she had never much loved, where she had
lived a life of sacrifice, suffering many partings, enduring
many pains. Glad to go, rejoicing that the end was
nigh, and soothed by the thought that beyond lay a

<p>When I arrive in Paris I always go
first to the Y.M.C.A. headquarters
in the Rue de Treville&mdash;that
fine building erected and presented
to the Association by Banker Stokes
of New York. There's a good table-d'hote
dinner there every day for
a franc; then there tare bathrooms
and writing-rooms and reading-rooms, and all are
yours if you are a stranger. The polite Secretary does
not look like a Christian: he has a very tight hair-cut,
a Vandyke beard and lists of lodgings that can be had
for twenty, fifteen or ten francs a week. Or, should you
be an American Millionaire and be willing to pay thirty
francs a week, the secretary knows a nice Protestant
lady who will rent you her front parlor on the first
floor and serve you coffee each morning without extra
charge.</p>

<p>Not being a millionaire, I decided, the last time I was
there, on a room at fifteen francs a week on the fourth
floor. A bright young fellow was called up, duly introduced,
and we started out to inspect the quarters.</p>

<p>The house we wanted was in a little side street that
leads off the Boulevard Montmartre. It was a very
narrow and plain little street, and I was somewhat disappointed.
Yet it was not a shabby street, for there are
<a name="II_Page_146"></a>none such in Paris; all was neat and clean, and as I
caught sight of a birdcage hanging in one of the windows
and a basket of ferns in another I was reassured
and rang the bell.</p>

<p>The landlady wore a white cap, a winning smile and a
big white apron. A bunch of keys dangling at her belt
gave the necessary look of authority. She was delighted
to see me&mdash;everybody is glad to see you in Paris&mdash;and
she would feel especially honored if I would consent
to remain under her roof. She only rented her rooms
to those who were sent to her by her friends, and
among her few dear friends none was so dear as Monsieur
ze Secretaire of ze Young Men Christians.</p>

<p>And so I was shown the room&mdash;away up and up and
up a dark winding stairway of stone steps with an iron
balustrade. It was a room about the size of a large
Jordan-Marsh drygoods-box.</p>

<p>The only thing that
tempted me to stay was the fact that the one window
was made up of little diamond panes set in a leaden
sash, and that this window looked out on a little courtway
where a dozen palms and as many ferns grew lush
and green in green tubs and where in the center a
fountain spurted. So a bargain was struck and the
landlady went downstairs to find her husband to send
him to the Gare Saint Lazare after my luggage.</p>

<p>What a relief it is to get settled in your own room! It
is home and this is your castle. You can do as you
please here; can I not take mine ease in mine inn?</p>

<p><a name="II_Page_147"></a>I took off my coat and hung it on the corner of the high
bedpost of the narrow, little bed and hung my collar
and cuffs on the floor; and then leaned out of the window
indulging in a drowsy dream of sweet content.
'Twas a long, dusty ride from Dieppe, but who cares&mdash;I
was now settled, with rent paid for a week!</p>

<p>All around the courtway were flower-boxes in the windows;
down below, the fountain cheerfully bubbled
and gurgled, and from clear off in the unseen rumbled
the traffic of the great city. And coming from somewhere,
as I sat there, was the shrill warble of a canary.
I looked down and around, but could not see the
feathered songster, as the novelists always call a bird.
Then I followed the advice of the Epworth League
and looked up, not down, out, not in, and there directly
over my head hung the cage all tied up in chiffon (I
think it was chiffon). I was surprised, for I felt sure it
could not be possible there was a room higher than
mine&mdash;when I had come up nine stairways! Then I
was more surprised; for just as I looked up, a woman
looked down and our eyes met. We both smiled a foolish
smile of surprise; she dodged in her head and I gazed
at the houses opposite with an interest quite unnecessary.</p>

<p>She was not a very young woman, nor very pretty&mdash;in
fact, she was rather plain&mdash;but when she leaned out
to feed her pet and found a man looking up at her she
proved her divine femininity beyond cavil. Was there
<a name="II_Page_148"></a>ever a more womanly action? And I said to myself,
&quot;She is not handsome&mdash;but God bless her, she is
human!&quot;</p>

<p>Details are tiresome&mdash;so suffice it to say that next day
the birdcage was lowered that I might divide my apple
with Dickie (for he was very fond of apple). The second
day, when the cage was lowered I not only fed Dickie
but wrote a message on the cuttlefish. The third day,
there was a note twisted in the wires of the cage inviting
me up to tea.</p>

<p>And I went.</p>
<p><a name="II_Page_149"></a></p>
<hr />

<p>There were four girls living up there in one
attic-room. Two of these girls were Americans,
one English and one French. One of the
American girls was round and pink and
twenty; the other was older. It was the older one that
owned the bird, and invited me up to tea. She met me
at the door, and we shook hands like old-time friends.
I was introduced to the trinity in a dignified manner,
and we were soon chatting in a way that made Dickie
envious, and he sang so loudly that one of the girls
covered the cage with a black apron.</p>

<p>With four girls I felt perfectly safe, and as for the girls
there was not a shadow of a doubt that they were safe,
for I am a married man. I knew they must be nice girls,
for they had birds and flower-boxes. I knew they had
flower-boxes, for twice it so happened that they sprinkled
the flowers while I was leaning out of the window
wrapped in reverie.</p>

<p>This attic was the most curious room I ever saw. It
was large&mdash;running clear across the house. It had four
gable-windows, and the ceiling sloped down on the
sides, so there was danger of bumping your head if you
played pussy-wants-a-corner. Each girl had a window
that she called her own, and the chintz curtains, made
of chiffon (I think it was chiffon), were tied back with
different-colored ribbons. This big room was divided
in the center by a curtain made of gunny-sack stuff,
and this curtain was covered with pictures such as were
<a name="II_Page_150"></a>never seen on land or sea. The walls were papered with
brown wrapping-paper, tacked up with brass-headed
nails, and this paper was covered with pictures such
as were never seen on sea or land.</p>

<p>The girls were all art students, and when they had
nothing else to do they worked on the walls, I imagined,
just as the Israelites did in Jerusalem years ago. One
half of the attic was studio, and this was where the
table was set. The other half of the attic had curious
chairs and divans and four little iron beds enameled in
white and gold, and each bed was so smoothly made up
that I asked what they were for. White Pigeon said they
were bric-a-brac&mdash;that the Attic Philosophers rolled
themselves up in the rugs on the floor when they wished
to sleep; but I have thought since that White Pigeon
was chaffing me.</p>

<p>White Pigeon was the one I saw that first afternoon
when I looked up, not down, out, not in. She was from
White Pigeon, Michigan, and from the very moment
I told her I had a cousin living at Coldwater who was
a conductor on the Lake Shore, we were as brother and
sister. White Pigeon was thirty or thirty-five, mebbe;
she had some gray hairs mixed in with the brown, and
at times there was a tinge of melancholy in her laugh
and a sort of half-minor key in her voice. I think she
had had a Past, but I don't know for sure.</p>

<p>Women under thirty seldom know much, unless Fate
has been kind and cuffed them thoroughly, so the little
<a name="II_Page_151"></a>peachblow Americaine did not interest me. The peachblow
was all gone from White Pigeon's cheek, but she
was fairly wise and reasonably good&mdash;I'm certain of
that. She called herself a student and spoke of her
pictures as &quot;studies,&quot; but she had lived in Paris ten
years. Peachblow was her pupil&mdash;sent over from Bradford,
Pennsylvania, where her father was a &quot;producer.&quot;
White Pigeon told me this after I had drunk five cups
of tea and the Anglaise and the Soubrette were doing
the dishes. Peachblow the while was petulantly taking
the color out of a canvas that was a false alarm.</p>

<p>White Pigeon had copied a Correggio in the Louvre
nine years before, and sold the canvas to a rich wagon-maker
from South Bend. Then orders came from South
Bend for six more Louvre masterpieces. It took a year
to complete the order and brought White Pigeon a
thousand dollars. She kept on copying and occasionally
receiving orders from America; and when no orders
came, potboilers were duly done and sent to worthy
Hebrews in Saint Louis who hold annual Art Receptions
and sell at auction paintings painted by distinguished
artists with unpronounceable names, who
send a little of their choice work to Saint Louis, because
the people in Saint Louis appreciate really choice things.</p>

<p>&quot;And the mural decorations&mdash;which one of you did
those?&quot; I remarked, as a long pause came stealing in.</p>

<p>&quot;Did you hear what Mr. Littlejourneys asked?&quot;
called White Pigeon to the others.</p>
<p><a name="II_Page_152"></a></p>
<p>&quot;No; what was it?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;He wants to know which one
of us decorated the walls!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Mr. Littlejourneys meant illumined the walls,&quot; jerked
Peachblow, over her shoulder.</p>

<p>Then Anglaise gravely brought a battered box of crayon
and told me I must make a picture somewhere on the
wall or ceiling: all the pictures were made by visitors&mdash;no
visitor was ever exempt.</p>

<p>I took the crayons and made a picture such as was
never seen on land or sea. Having thus placed myself
on record, I began to examine the other decorations.
There were heads and faces, and architectural scraps,
trees and animals, and bits of landscape and ships that
pass in the night. Most of the work was decidedly
sketchy, but some of the faces were very good.</p>

<p>Suddenly my eye spied the form of a sleeping dog, a
great shaggy Saint Bernard with head outstretched on
his paws, sound asleep. I stopped and whistled.</p>

<p>The girls laughed.</p>

<p>&quot;It is only the picture of a dog,&quot; said Soubrette.</p>

<p>&quot;I know; but you should pay dog-tax on such a picture&mdash;did
you draw it?&quot; I asked White Pigeon.</p>

<p>&quot;Did I! If I could draw like that, would I copy pictures
in the Louvre?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, who drew it?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Can't you guess?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Of course I can guess. I am a Yankee&mdash;I guess Rosa
Bonheur.&quot;</p>
<p><a name="II_Page_153"></a></p>
<p>&quot;Well, you have guessed right.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Stop joking and
tell me who drew the Saint Bernard.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Madame Rosalie, or Rosa Bonheur, as you call her.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But she never came here!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, she did&mdash;once. Soubrette is her great-grandniece,
or something.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, and Madame Bonheur pays my way and keeps
me in the Ecole des Beaux Arts. I'm not ashamed for
Monsieur Littlejourneys to know!&quot; said Soubrette
with a pretty pout; &quot;I'm from Lyons, and my mother
and Madame Rosalie used to know each other years
ago.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Will Madame Rosalie, as you call her, ever come here
again?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Perhaps.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Then I'll camp right here till she comes!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You might stay a year and then be disappointed.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Then can't we go to see her?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Never; she does not see visitors.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;We might go visit her home,&quot; mused Soubrette, after
a pause.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, if she is away,&quot; said Anglaise.</p>

<p>&quot;She's away now,&quot; said Soubrette; &quot;she went to
Rouen yesterday.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, when shall we go?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Tomorrow.&quot;</p>
<p><a name="II_Page_154"></a></p>
<hr />
<p>And so Soubrette could not think of going when
it looked so much like rain, and Anglaise
could not think of going without Soubrette,
and Peachblow was getting nervous about
the coming examinations, and must study, as she knew
she would just die if she failed to pass.</p>

<p>&quot;You will anyway&mdash;sometime!&quot; said White Pigeon.</p>

<p>&quot;Don't urge her; she may change her mind and go with
you,&quot; dryly remarked Anglaise with back towards us
as she dusted the mantel.</p>

<p>Then I expressed my regret that the trinity could not
go, and White Pigeon expressed her regret because they
had to stay at home. And as we went down the stairs
together we chanted the Kyrie eleison for our small
sins, easing conscience by the mutual confession that
we were arrant hypocrites.</p>

<p>&quot;But still,&quot; mused White Pigeon, not quite satisfied,
&quot;we really did not tell an untruth&mdash;that is, we did not
deceive them&mdash;they understood&mdash;I wouldn't tell a real
whopper, would you?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I don't know&mdash;I think I did once.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Tell me about it,&quot; said White Pigeon.</p>

<p>But I was saved, for just as we reached the bottom stair
there was a slight jingling of keys, and the landlady
came up through the floor with a big lunch-basket. She
pushed the basket into my hands and showering us with
Lombardy French pushed us out of the door, and away
we went into the morning gray, the basket carried
<a name="II_Page_155"></a>between us. The basket had a hinged cover, and out of
one corner emerged the telltale neck of a bottle. It did
not look just right; suppose we should meet some one
from Coldwater?</p>

<p>But we did not meet any one from Coldwater. And
when we reached the railway-station we were quite
lost in the crowd, for there were dozens of picnickers all
carrying baskets, and from the cover of each basket
emerged the neck of a bottle. We felt quite at home
packed away in a Classe Trois carriage with a chattering
party of six High-School botanizing youngsters. When
the guard came to the window, touched his cap,
addressing me as Le Professeur, and asked for the
tickets for my family, they all laughed.</p>

<p>Fontainebleau was the fourth stop from Paris. My
family scampered out and away and we followed
leisurely after. Fontainebleau is quite smug. There is a
fashionable hotel near the station, before which a fine
tall fellow in uniform parades. He looked at our basket
with contempt, and we looked at him in pity. Just
beyond the hotel are smart shops with windows filled
with many-colored trifles to tempt the tourist. The
shops gradually grew smaller and less gay, and residences
with high stone walls in front took their places,
and over these walls roses nodded. Then there came a
wide stretch of pasture, and the town of Fontainebleau
was left behind.</p>

<p>The sun came out and came out and came out; birds
<a name="II_Page_156"></a>chirruped in the hedgerows and the daws in the high
poplars called and scolded. The mist still lingered on the
distant hills, and we could hear the tinkle of sheep-bells
and the barking of a dog coming out of the nothingness.</p>

<p>White Pigeon wore flat-soled shoes and measured off
the paces with an easy swing. We walked in silence,
filled with the rich quiet of country sounds and country
sights. What a relief to get away from noisy, bustling,
busy Paris! God made the country!</p>

<p>All at once the mists seemed to lift from the long range
of hills on the right and revealed the dark background
of forest, broken here and there with jutting rocks and
beetling crags. We stopped and sat down on the bank-side
to view the scene. Close up under the shadow of the
dark forest nestled a little white village. Near it was the
red-tile roof of an old mansion, half-lost in the foliage.
All around this old mansion I could make out a string
of small buildings or additions to the original chateau.</p>

<p>I looked at White Pigeon and she looked at me.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes; that is the place!&quot; she said.</p>

<p>The sun's rays were growing warmer. I took off my coat
and tucked it through the handle of the basket. White
Pigeon took off her jacket to keep it company, and
toting the basket, slung on my cane between us, we
moved on up the gently winding way to the village of
By. Everybody was asleep at By, or else gone on a
journey. Soon we came to the old, massive, moss-covered
gateposts that marked the entrance to the mansion. A
<a name="II_Page_157"></a>chain was stretched across the entrance and we crawled
under. The driveway was partly overgrown with grass,
and the place seemed to be taking care of itself. Half
a dozen long-horned Bonnie Brier Bush cows were
grazing on the lawn, their calves with them; and evidently
these cows and calves were the only mowing-machines
employed. On this wide-stretching meadow
were various old trees; one elm I saw had fallen split
through the center&mdash;each part prostrate, yet growing
green.</p>

<p>Close up about the house there was an irregular stone
wall and an ornamental iron gate with a pull-out
Brugglesmith bell at one side. We pulled the bell and
were answered by a big shaggy Saint Bernard that came
barking and bouncing around the corner. I thought at
first our time had come. But this giant of a dog only
approached within about ten feet, then lay down on
the grass and rolled over three times to show his goodwill.
He got up with a fine, cheery smile shown in the
wag of his tail, just as a little maid unlocked the gate.</p>

<p>&quot;Don't you know that dog?&quot; asked White Pigeon.</p>

<p>&quot;Certainement&mdash;he is on the wall of your room.&quot;</p>

<p>We were shown into a little reception-parlor, where we
were welcomed by a tall, handsome woman, about White
Pigeon's age.</p>

<p>The woman kissed White Pigeon on
one cheek, and I afterwards asked White Pigeon why she
didn't turn to me the other, and she said I was a fool.</p>

<p>Then the tall woman went to the door and called up
<a name="II_Page_158"></a>the stairway: &quot;Antoine, Antoine, guess who it is?
It's White Pigeon!&quot;</p>

<p>A man came down the stairs three steps at a time, and
took both of White Pigeon's hands in his, after the
hearty manner of a gentleman of France. Then I was
introduced.</p>

<p>Antoine looked at our lunch-basket with the funniest
look I ever saw, and asked what it was.</p>

<p>&quot;Lunch,&quot; said White Pigeon; &quot;I can not tell a lie!&quot;</p>

<p>Antoine made wild gesticulations of displeasure,
denouncing us in pantomime.</p>

<p>But White Pigeon explained that we only came on a
quiet picnic in search of ozone and had dropped in to
make a little call before we went on up to the forest.
But could we see the horses?</p>

<p>Antoine would be most delighted to show Monsieur
Littlejourneys anything that was within his power. In
fact, everything hereabouts was the absolute property
of Monsieur Littlejourneys to do with as he pleased.</p>

<p>He disappeared up the stairway to exchange his slippers
for shoes, and the tall woman went in another direction
for her hat. I whispered to White Pigeon, &quot;Can't we
see the studio?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Are we from Chicago, that we should seek to prowl
through a private house, when the mistress is away?
No; there are partly finished canvases up there that
are sacred.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Come this way,&quot; said Antoine. He led us out through
<a name="II_Page_159"></a>the library, then the dining-room and through the
kitchen.</p>

<p>It is a very comfortable old place, with no extra
furniture&mdash;the French know better than to burden
themselves with things.</p>

<p>The long line of brick stables seemed made up of a
beggarly array of empty stalls. We stopped at a paddock,
and Antoine opened the gate and said, &quot;There
they are!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The horses.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But these are broncos.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes; I believe that is what you call them. Monsieur
Bill of Buffalo, New York, sent them as a present to
Madame Rosalie when he was in Paris.&quot;</p>

<p>There they were&mdash;two ewe-necked cayuses&mdash;one a
pinto with a wall-eye; the other a dun with a black line
down the back.</p>

<p>I challenged Antoine to saddle them and we would
ride. The tall lady took it in dead earnest, and throwing
her arms around Antoine's neck begged him not to
commit suicide.</p>

<p>&quot;And the Percherons&mdash;where are they?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Goodness! we have no Perches.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Those that served as models for the 'Horse Fair,' I
mean.&quot;</p>

<p>White Pigeon took me gently by the sleeve, and turning
to the others apologized for my ignorance, explaining
<a name="II_Page_160"></a>that I did not know the &quot;Marche aux Chevaux&quot; was
painted over forty years ago, and that the models were
all Paris cart-horses.</p>

<p>Antoine called up a little old man, who led out two
shaggy little cobs, and I was told that these were the
horses that Madame drove. A roomy, old-fashioned
basket phaeton was backed out; White Pigeon and I
stepped in to try it, and Antoine drew us once around
the stable-yard. This is the only carriage Madame uses.
There were doves, and chickens, and turkeys, and
rabbits; and these horses we had seen, with the cows
on the lawn, make up all the animals owned by the
greatest of living animal-painters.</p>

<p>Years ago Rosa Bonheur had a stableful of horses and
a kennel of dogs and a park with deer. Many animals
were sent as presents. One man forwarded a lion, and
another a brace of tigers, but Madame made haste to
present them to the Zoological Garden at Paris, because
the folks at By would not venture out of their houses&mdash;a
report having been spread that the lions were loose.</p>

<p>&quot;An animal-painter no more wants to own the objects
he paints than a landscape-artist wishes a deed for the
mountain he is sketching,&quot; said Antoine.</p>

<p>&quot;Or to marry his model,&quot; interposed White Pigeon.</p>

<p>&quot;If you see your model too often, you will lose her,&quot;
added the Tall Lady.</p>

<p>We bade our friends good-by and trudged on up the
hillside to the storied Forest of Fontainebleau. We sat
<a name="II_Page_161"></a>down on a log and watched the winding Seine stretching
away like a monstrous serpent, away down across the
meadow; just at our feet was the white village of By;
beyond was Thomeray, and off to the left rose the spires
of Fontainebleau.</p>

<p>&quot;And who is this Antoine and who is the Tall Lady?&quot;
I asked, as White Pigeon began to unpack the basket.</p>

<p>&quot;It's quite a romance; are you sure you want to hear
it?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I must hear it.&quot;</p>

<p>And so between bites White Pigeon told me the story.</p>

<p>The Tall Lady is a niece of Madame Rosalie's. She
was married to an army officer at Bordeaux when she
was sixteen years old. Her husband treated her shamefully;
he beat her and forced her to write begging letters
and to borrow money of her relatives, and then he would
take this money and waste it gambling and in drink.
In short, he was a Brute.</p>

<p>Madame Rosalie accidentally heard of all this, and one
day went down to Bordeaux and took the Tall Lady
away from the Brute and told him she would kill him
if he followed.</p>

<p>&quot;Did she paint a picture of the Brute?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Keep quiet, please!&quot;</p>

<p>She told him she would kill him if he followed, and
although she is usually very gentle I believe she would
have kept her word. Well, she brought the Tall Lady
with her to By, and this old woman and this young
<a name="II_Page_162"></a>woman loved each other very much.</p>

<p>Now, Madame Rosalie had a butler and combination man
of business, by name of Jules Carmonne. He was a painter
of some ability and served Madame in many ways right faithfully.
Jules loved the Tall Lady, or said he did, but
she did not care for him. He was near fifty and asthmatic
and had watery eyes. He made things very
uncomfortable for the Tall Lady.</p>

<p>One night Jules came to Madame Rosalie in great
indignation and said he could not consent to remain
longer on account of the way things were going on.
What was the trouble? Trouble enough, when the Tall
Lady was sneaking out of the house after decent folks
were in bed, to meet a strange man down in the evergreens!
Well I guess so!!</p>

<p>How did he know?</p>

<p>Ah, he had followed her. Moreover, he had concealed
himself in the evergreens and waited for them, to make
sure.</p>

<p>Yes, and who was the man?</p>

<p>A young rogue of a painter from Fontainebleau named
Antoine de Channeville.</p>

<p>Madame Rosalie took Jules Carmonne at his word. She
said she was sorry he could not stay, but he might go
if he wished to, of course. And she paid him his salary
on the spot&mdash;with two months more to the end of the
year.</p>

<p>The next day Madame Rosalie drove her team of
<a name="II_Page_163"></a>shaggy ponies down to Fontainebleau and called on the
young rogue of an artist. He came out bareheaded and
quaking to where she sat in the phaeton waiting. She
flecked the off pony twice and told him that as Carmonne
had left her she must have a man to help her.
Would he come? And she named as salary a sum about
five times what he was then making.</p>

<p>Antoine de Channeville seized the wheel of the phaeton
for support, gasped several gasps, and said he would
come.</p>

<p>He was getting barely enough to eat out of his work,
anyway, although he was a very worthy young fellow.
And he came.</p>

<p>He and the Tall Lady were married about six months
after.</p>

<p>&quot;And about the Brute and&mdash;and the divorce!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Gracious goodness! How do I know? I guess the Brute
died or something; anyway, Antoine and the Tall Lady
are man and wife, and are devoted lovers besides. They
have served Madame Rosalie most loyally for these
fifteen years. They say Madame Rosalie has made her
will and has left them the mansion and everything in
it for their ownest own, with a tidy sum besides to put
on interest.&quot;</p>

<p>It was four o'clock when we got back to the railroad-station
at Fontainebleau. We missed the train we
expected to take, and had an hour to wait. White
Pigeon said she did not care so very much, and I'm
<a name="II_Page_164"></a>sure I didn't. So we sat down in the bright little
waiting-room, and White Pigeon told me many things
about Madame Rosalie and her early life that I had
never known before.</p>
<p><a name="II_Page_165"></a></p>
<hr />

<p>Early in the century there lived in Bordeaux
a struggling artist (artists always struggle,
you know) by the name of Raymond Bonheur.
He found life a cruel thing, for bread
was high in price and short in weight, and no one seemed
to appreciate art except the folks who had no money
to buy. But the poor can love as well as the rich, and
Raymond married. In his nervous desire for success,
Raymond Bonheur said that if he could only have a
son he would teach him how to do it, and the son would
achieve the honors that the world withheld from the
father.</p>

<p>So the days came and went, and a son was expected&mdash;a
firstborn&mdash;an heir. There wasn't anything to be heir
to except genius, but there was plenty of that. The heir
was to bear the name of the father&mdash;Raymond Bonheur.</p>

<p>Prayers were offered and thanksgivings sung.</p>

<p>The days were fulfilled. The child was born.</p>

<p>The heir was a girl.</p>

<p>Raymond Bonheur cursed wildly and tousled his hair
like a bouffe artist. He swore he had been tricked,
trapped, seduced, undone. He would have bought
strong drink, but he had no money, and credit, like
hope, was gone.</p>

<p>The little mother cried.</p>

<p>But the baby grew, although it wasn't a very big baby.
They named her Rosa, because the initial was the same
as Raymond, but they always called her Rosalie.</p>
<p><a name="II_Page_166"></a></p>
<p>Then in a year another baby came, and that was a
boy. In two years another, but Raymond never forgave
his wife that first offense. He continued to struggle,
trying various styles of pictures and ever hoping he
would yet hit on what the public desired. Mr. Vanderbilt
had not yet made his famous remark about the public,
and how could Raymond plagiarize it in advance?</p>

<p>At last he got money enough to get to Paris&mdash;ah, yes,
Paris, Paris, there talent is appreciated!</p>

<p>In Paris another baby was born&mdash;it was looked upon as
a calamity. The poor little mother of the four little
shivering Bonheurs ceased to struggle. She lay quite
still, and they covered her face with a white sheet and
talked in whispers, and walked on tiptoe, for she
was dead.</p>

<p>When an artist can not succeed, he begins to teach art&mdash;that
is, he shows others how. Raymond Bonheur put his
four children out among kinsmen in four different
places, and became drawing-master in a private school.
Rosa Bonheur was ten years old: a pug-nosed, square-faced
little girl in a linsey-woolsey dress, wooden shoon,
with a yellow braid hanging down her back tied with
a shoestring. She could draw&mdash;all children can draw&mdash;and
the first things children draw are animals.</p>

<p>Her
father had taught her a little and laughed at her foolish
little lions and tigers, all duly labeled.</p>

<p>When twelve years of age the good people with whom
she lived said she must learn dressmaking. She should
<a name="II_Page_167"></a>be an artist of the needle. But after some months she
rebelled and, making her way across the city to where
her father was, demanded that he should teach her
drawing. Raymond Bonheur hadn't much will&mdash;this
controversy proved that&mdash;the child mastered, and the
father, who really was an accomplished draftsman,
began giving daily lessons to the girl. Soon they worked
together in the Louvre, copying pictures.</p>

<p>It was a queer thing to teach a girl art&mdash;there were no
women artists then. People laughed to see a little girl
with yellow braid mixing paints and helping her father
in the Louvre; others said it wasn't right.</p>

<p>&quot;Let's cut off the braid, and I'll wear boy's clothes
and be a boy,&quot; said funny little Rosalie.</p>

<p>Next day, Raymond Bonheur had a close-cropped boy
in loose trousers and blue blouse to help him.</p>

<p>The pictures they copied began to sell. Buyers said the
work was strong and true. Prosperity came that way,
and Raymond Bonheur got his four children together
and rented three rooms in a house at One Hundred
Fifty-seven Faubourg Saint Honore.</p>

<p>Rosalie saw that her father had always tried to please
the public; she would please no one but herself. He had
tried many forms; she would stick to one. She would
paint animals and nothing else.</p>

<p>When eighteen years old, she painted a picture of
rabbits, for the Salon. The next year she tried again.
She made the acquaintance of an honest old farmer at
<a name="II_Page_168"></a>Villiers and went to live in his household. She painted
pictures of all the livestock he possessed, from rabbits
to a Norman stallion. One of the pictures she then made
was that of a favorite Holland cow. A collector came
down from Paris and offered three hundred francs for
the picture.</p>

<p>&quot;Merciful Jesus!&quot; said the pious farmer; &quot;say nothing,
but get the money quick! The live cow herself isn't
worth half that!&quot;</p>

<p>The members of the Bonheur family married, one by
one, including the father. Rosa did not marry: she
painted. She discarded all teachers, all schools; she did
not listen to the suggestions of patrons, and even
refused to make pictures to order.</p>

<p>And be it said to
her credit, she never has allowed a buyer to dictate the
subject. She followed her own ideas in everything; she
wore men's clothes, and does even unto this day.</p>

<p>When she was twenty-five, the Salon awarded her a
gold medal. The Ministere des Beaux Arts paid her
three thousand francs for her &quot;Labourge Nivernais.&quot;</p>

<p>Raymond Bonheur grew ill in Eighteen Hundred
Forty-nine, but before he passed out he realized that his
daughter, then twenty-seven years old, was on a level
with the greatest masters, living or dead.</p>

<p>She began &quot;The Horse Fair&quot; when twenty-eight. It
was the largest canvas ever attempted by an animal-painter.
It was exhibited at the Salon in Eighteen
Hundred Fifty-three, and all the gabble of jealous
<a name="II_Page_169"></a>competitors was lost in the glorious admiration it
excited. It became the rage of Paris. All the honors the
Salon could bestow were heaped upon the young woman,
and by special decision all her work henceforth was
declared exempt from examination by the Jury of
Admission. Rosa Bonheur, five feet four, weighing one
hundred twenty pounds, was bigger than the Salon.</p>

<p>But success did not cause her to swerve a hair's breadth
from her manner of work or life. She refused all social
invitations, and worked away after her own method as
industriously as ever. When a picture was completed,
she set her price on it and it was sold.</p>

<p>In Eighteen Hundred Sixty she bought this fine old
house at By, that she might work in quiet. Society tried
to follow her, and in Eighteen Hundred Sixty-four the
Emperor Napoleon and Empress Eugenie went to By,
and the Empress pinned to the blue blouse of Rosa Bonheur
the Cross of the Legion of Honor, the first time, I
believe, that the distinction was ever conferred on a
woman.</p>

<p>And now at seventy-four she is still in love with life,
and while taking a woman's tender interest in all sweet
and gentle things, has yet an imagination that in its
strength and boldness is splendidly masculine.</p>

<p>Rosa
Bonheur has received all the honors that man can give.
She is rich; no words of praise that tongue can utter can
add to her fame; and she is loved by all who know her.

<p><br /><a name="II_Page_174"></a><a name="II_Page_175"></a></p>

<p>Fate was very kind to Madame De
Stael.</p>

<p>She ran the gamut of life from highest
love to direst pain&mdash;from rosy
dawn to blackest night. Name if you
can another woman who touched
life at so many points! Home,
health, wealth, strength, honors,
affection, applause, motherhood, loss, danger, death,
defeat, sacrifice, humiliation, illness, banishment, imprisonment,
escape. Again comes hope&mdash;returning
strength, wealth, recognition, fame tempered by opposition,
home, a few friends, and kindly death&mdash;cool, all-enfolding
death.</p>

<p>If Harriet Martineau showed poor judgment in choosing
her parents, we can lay no such charge to the account
of Madame De Stael.</p>

<p>They called her &quot;The Daughter of Necker,&quot; and all
through life she delighted in the title. The courtier who
addressed her thus received a sunny smile and a gentle
love-tap on his cheek for pay. A splendid woman is
usually the daughter of her father, just as strong men
have noble mothers.</p>

<p>Jacques Necker was born in Geneva, and went up to
the city, like many another country boy, to make his
fortune. He carried with him to Paris innocence, health,
<a name="II_Page_176"></a>high hope, and twenty francs in silver. He found a place
as porter or &quot;trotter&quot; in a bank. Soon they made him
clerk.</p>

<p>A letter came one day from a correspondent asking for
a large loan, and setting forth a complex financial
scheme in which the bank was invited to join. M. Vernet,
the head of the establishment, was away, and young
Necker took the matter in hand. He made a detailed
statement of the scheme, computed probable losses,
weighed the pros and cons, and when the employer
returned, the plan, all worked out, was on his desk,
with young Necker's advice that the loan be made.</p>

<p>&quot;You seem to know all about banking!&quot; was the
sarcastic remark of M. Vernet.</p>

<p>&quot;I do,&quot; was the proud answer.</p>

<p>&quot;You know too much; I'll just put you back as porter.&quot;</p>

<p>The Genevese accepted the reduction and went back
as porter without repining. A man of small sense would
have resigned his situation at once, just as men are ever
forsaking Fortune when she is about to smile; witness
Cato committing suicide on the very eve of success.</p>

<p>There is always a demand for efficient men; the market
is never glutted; the cities are hungry for them&mdash;but the
trouble is, few men are efficient.</p>

<p>&quot;It was none of his business!&quot; said M. Vernet to his
partner, trying to ease conscience with reasons.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes; but see how he accepted the inevitable!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ah! true, he has two qualities that are the property
<a name="II_Page_177"></a>only of strong men: confidence and resignation. I think&mdash;I
think I was hasty!&quot;</p>

<p>So young Necker was reinstated, and in six months was
cashier, in three years a partner.</p>

<p>Not long after, he
married Susanna Curchod, a poor governess.</p>

<p>But
Mademoiselle Curchod was rich in mental endowment:
refined, gentle, spiritual, she was a true mate to the
high-minded Necker. She was a Swiss, too, and if you
know how a young man and a young woman, countryborn,
in a strange city are attracted to each other, you
will better understand this particular situation.</p>

<p>Some years before, Gibbon had loved and courted the
beautiful Mademoiselle Curchod in her quiet home in
the Jura Mountains. They became engaged. Gibbon
wrote home, breaking the happy news to his parents.</p>

<p>&quot;Has the beautiful Curchod of whom you sing, a large
dowry?&quot; inquired the mother.</p>

<p>&quot;She has no dowry! I can not tell a lie,&quot; was the meek
answer. The mother came on and extinguished the
match in short order.</p>

<p>Gibbon never married. But he frankly tells us all about
his love for Susanna Curchod, and relates how he
visited her, in her splendid Paris home. &quot;She greeted
me without embarrassment,&quot; says Gibbon, resentfully;
&quot;and in the evening Necker left us together in the
parlor, bade me good-night, and lighting a candle went
off to bed!&quot;</p>

<p>Gibbon, historian and philosopher, was made of
<a name="II_Page_178"></a>common clay (for authors are made of clay, like plain
mortals), and he could not quite forgive Madame Necker
for not being embarrassed on meeting her former lover,
neither could he forgive Necker for not being jealous.</p>

<p>But that only daughter of the Neckers, Germaine,
pleased Gibbon&mdash;pleased him better than the mother,
and Gibbon extended his stay in Paris and called often.</p>

<p>&quot;She was a splendid creature,&quot; Gibbon relates; &quot;only
seventeen, but a woman grown, physically and mentally;
not handsome, but dazzling, brilliant, emotional,
sensitive, daring!&quot;</p>

<p>Gibbon was a bit of a romanticist, as all historians are,
and he no doubt thought it would be a fine denouement to
life's play to capture the daughter of his old sweetheart,
and avenge himself on Fate and the unembarrassed
Madame Necker and the unpiqued husband, all at one
fell stroke&mdash;and she would not be dowerless either.
Ha, ha!</p>

<p>But Gibbon forgot that he was past forty, short in
stature, and short of breath, and &quot;miles around,&quot; as
Talleyrand put it.</p>

<p>&quot;I quite like you,&quot; said the daring daughter, as the
eloquent Gibbon sat by her side at a dinner.</p>

<p>&quot;Why shouldn't you like me&mdash;I came near being your
papa!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I know, and would I have looked like you?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Perhaps.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What a calamity!&quot;</p>
<p><a name="II_Page_179"></a></p>
<p>Even then she possessed that same bubbling wit that was
hers years later when she sat at table with D'Alembert.
On one side of the great author was Madame Recamier,
famous for beauty (and later for a certain &quot;Beauty-Cream&quot;),
on the other the daughter of Necker.</p>

<p>&quot;How fortunate!&quot; exclaimed D'Alembert with rapture;
&quot;how fortunate I sit between Wit and Beauty!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, and without possessing either,&quot; said Wit.</p>

<p>No mistake, the girl's intellect was too speedy even for
Gibbon. She fenced all 'round him and over him, and
he soon discovered that she was icily gracious to every
one, save her father alone. For him she seemed to outpour
all the lavish love of her splendid womanhood. It
was unlike the usual calm affection of father and daughter.
It was a great and absorbing love, of which even
the mother was jealous.</p>

<p>&quot;I can't just exactly make 'em out,&quot; said Gibbon, and
withdrew in good order.</p>

<p>Before Necker was forty he had accumulated a fortune,
and retired from business to devote himself to literature
and the polite arts.</p>

<p>&quot;I have earned a rest,&quot; he said; &quot;besides, I must
have leisure to educate my daughter.&quot;</p>

<p>Men are constantly &quot;retiring&quot; from business, but
someway the expected Elysium of leisure forever eludes
us. Necker had written several good pamphlets and
showed the world that he had ability outside of money-making.
He was appointed Resident Minister of Geneva
<a name="II_Page_180"></a>at the Court of France. Soon after he became President
of the French East India Company, because there was
no one else with mind broad enough to fill the place.
His house was the gathering-place of many eminent
scholars and statesmen. Necker was quiet and reserved;
his wife coldly brilliant, cultured, dignified, religious.
The daughter made good every deficiency in both.</p>

<p>She was tall, finely formed, but her features were rather
heavy, and in repose there was a languor in her manner
and a blankness in her face. This seeming dulness marks
all great actors, but the heaviness is only on the surface;
it often covers a sleeping volcano. On recognizing an
acquaintance, Germaine Necker's face would be illumined,
and her smile would light a room. She could
pronounce a man's name so he would be ready to throw
himself at her feet, or over a precipice for her. And she
could listen in a way that complimented; and by a sigh,
a nod, an exclamation, bring out the best&mdash;such
thoughts as a man never knew he had. She made
people surprise themselves with their own genius; thus
proving that to make a good impression means to make
the man pleased with himself. &quot;Any man can be brilliant
with her,&quot; said a nettled competitor; &quot;but if she
wishes, she can sink all women in a room into creeping
things.&quot;</p>

<p>She knew how to compliment without flattering; her
cordiality warmed like wine, and her ready wit, repartee,
and ability to thaw all social ice and lead conversation
<a name="II_Page_181"></a>along any line, were accomplishments which perhaps
have never been equaled. The women who &quot;entertain&quot;
often only depress; they are so glowing that
everybody else feels himself punk. And these people
who are too clever are very numerous; they seem
inwardly to fear rivals, and are intent on working while
it is called the day.</p>

<p>Over against these are the celebrities who sit in a
corner and smile knowingly when they are expected to
scintillate. And the individual who talks too much at
one time is often painfully silent at another&mdash;as if he
had made New-Year resolves. But the daughter of
Necker entered into conversation with candor and
abandon; she gave herself to others, and knew whether
they wished to talk or to listen. On occasion, she could
monopolize conversation until she seemed the only
person in the room; but all talent was brighter for the
added luster of her own. This simplicity, this utter
frankness, this complete absence of self-consciousness,
was like the flight of a bird that never doubts its power,
simply because it never thinks of it. Yet continual
power produces arrogance, and the soul unchecked
finally believes in its own omniscience.</p>

<p>Of course such a matrimonial prize as the daughter of
Necker was sought for, even fought for. But the women
who can see clear through a man, like a Roentgen ray,
do not invite soft demonstration. They give passion a
chill. Love demands a little illusion; it must be clothed
<a name="II_Page_182"></a>in mystery. And although we find evidences that many
youths stood in the hallways and sighed, the daughter
of Necker never saw fit by a nod to bring them to her
feet. She was after bigger game&mdash;she desired the admiration
and approbation of archbishops, cardinals,
generals, statesmen, great authors.</p>

<p>Germaine Necker had no conception of what love is.</p>

<p>Many women never have. Had this fine young woman
met a man with intellect as clear, mind as vivid, and
heart as warm as her own, and had he pierced her
through with a wit as strong and keen as she herself
wielded, her pride would have been broken and she
might have paused. Then they might have looked into
each other's eyes and lost self there. And had she thus
known love it would have been a complete passion, for
the woman seemed capable of it.</p>

<p>A better pen than mine has written, &quot;A woman's love
is a dog's love.&quot; The dog that craves naught else but
the presence of his master, who is faithful to the one
and whines out his life on that master's grave, waiting
for the caress that never comes and the cheery voice
that is never heard&mdash;that's the way a woman loves!
A woman may admire, respect, revere and obey, but she
does not love until a passion seizes upon her that has
in it the abandon of Niagara. Do you remember how
Nancy Sikes crawls inch by inch to reach the hand of
Bill, and reaching it, tenderly caresses the coarse fingers
that a moment before clutched her throat, and dies
<a name="II_Page_183"></a>content? That's the love of woman! The prophet spoke
of something &quot;passing the love of woman,&quot; but the
prophet was wrong&mdash;there's nothing does.</p>

<p>So Germaine Necker, the gracious, the kindly, the
charming, did not love. However, she married&mdash;married
Baron De Stael, the Swedish Ambassador. He was
thirty-seven, she was twenty. De Stael was good-looking,
polite, educated. He always smiled at the right time,
said bright things in the right way, kept silence when
he should, and made no enemies because he agreed with
everybody about everything. Stipulations were made;
a long agreement was drawn up; it was signed by the
party of the first and duly executed by the party of the
second part; sealed, witnessed, sworn to, and the priest
was summoned.</p>

<p>It was a happy marriage. The first three years of married
life were the happiest Madame De Stael ever knew, she
said long afterward.</p>

<p>Possibly there are hasty people who imagine they detect
tincture of iron somewhere in these pages: these good
people will say, &quot;Gracious me! why not?&quot;</p>

<p>And so I will at once admit that these respectable,
well-arranged, and carefully planned marriages are
often happy and peaceful.</p>

<p>The couple may &quot;raise&quot;
a large family and slide through life and out of it without
a splash. I will also admit that love does not necessarily
imply happiness&mdash;more often 't is a pain, a wild
yearning, and a vague unrest; a haunting sense of
<a name="II_Page_184"></a>heart-hunger that drives a man into exile repeating
abstractedly the name &quot;Beatrice! Beatrice!&quot;
And so all the moral I will make now is simply this:
the individual who has not known an all-absorbing
love has not the spiritual vision that is a passport to
Paradise. He forever yammers between the worlds, fit
for neither Heaven nor Hell.</p>
<p><a name="II_Page_185"></a></p>
<hr />
<p>Necker retired from business that he might
enjoy peace; his daughter married for the
same reason. It was stipulated that she should
never be separated from her father. She who
stipulates is lost, so far as love goes&mdash;but no matter!
Married women in France are greater lions in society
than maidens can possibly hope to be. The marriage-certificate
serves at once as a license for brilliancy,
daring, splendor, and it is also a badge of respectability.
The marriage-certificate is a document that in all countries
is ever taken care of by the woman and never by
the man.</p>

<p>And this document is especially useful in
France, as French dames know. Frenchmen are afraid
of an unmarried woman&mdash;she means danger, damages,
a midnight marriage and other awful things. An unmarried
woman in France can not hope to be a social leader;
and to be a social leader was the one ambition of
Madame De Stael.</p>

<p>It was called the salon of Madame De Stael now.
Baron De Stael was known as the husband of Madame
De Stael. The salon of Madame Necker was only a
matter of reminiscence. The daughter of Necker was
greater than her father, and as for Madame Necker,
she was a mere figure in towering headdress, point lace
and diamonds. Talleyrand summed up the case when
he said, &quot;She is one of those dear old things that have
to be tolerated.&quot;</p>

<p>Madame De Stael had a taste for literature from early
<a name="II_Page_186"></a>womanhood. She wrote beautiful little essays and read
them aloud to her company, and her manuscripts had a
circulation like unto her father's bank-notes. She had
the faculty of absorbing beautiful thoughts and sentiments,
and no woman ever expressed them in a more
graceful way. People said she was the greatest woman
author of her day. &quot;You mean of all time,&quot; corrected
Diderot. They called her &quot;the High Priestess of
Letters,&quot; &quot;the Minerva of Poetry,&quot; &quot;Sappho Returned,&quot;
and all that. Her commendation meant success
and her indifference failure. She knew politics, too, and
her hands were on all wires. Did she wish to placate a
minister, she invited him to call, and once there he was
as putty in her hands. She skimmed the surface of all
languages, all arts, all history, but best of all she knew
the human heart.</p>

<p>Of course there was a realm of knowledge she wist not
of&mdash;the initiates of which never ventured within her
scope. She had nothing for them&mdash;they kept away. But
the proud, the vain, the ambitious, the ennui-ridden,
the people-who-wish-to-be, and who are ever looking
for the strong man to give them help&mdash;these thronged
her parlors.</p>

<p>And when you have named these you have named all
those who are foremost in commerce, politics, art,
education, philanthropy and religion. The world is run
by second-rate people. The best are speedily crucified,
or else never heard of until long after they are dead.</p>
<p><a name="II_Page_187"></a></p>
<p>Madame De Stael, in Seventeen Hundred Eighty-eight,
was queen of the people who ran the world&mdash;-at least
the French part of it.</p>

<p>But intellectual power, like physical strength, endures
but for a day. Giants who have a giant's strength and

<hr />
<p>Madame De Stael was of an intensely
religious nature throughout her entire life;
such characters swing between license and
asceticism. But the charge of atheism told
largely against her even among the so-called liberals,
for liberals are often very illiberal. Marie Antoinette
gathered her skirts close about her and looked at the
&quot;Minerva of Letters&quot; with suspicion in her big, open
eyes; cabinet officers forgot her requests to call, and
when a famous wit once coolly asked, &quot;Who was that
Madame De Stael we used to read about?&quot; people
roared with laughter.</p>

<p>Necker, as Minister of Finance, had saved the State
from financial ruin; then had been deposed and banished;
then recalled. In September, Seventeen Hundred
Ninety, he was again compelled to flee. He escaped to
Switzerland, disguised as a pedler. The daughter wished
to accompany him, but this was impossible, for only a
week before she had given birth to her first child.</p>

<p>But favor came back, and in the mad tumult of the
times the freedom of wit and sparkle of her salon
became a need to the poets and philosophers, if city
wits can be so called.</p>

<p>Society shone as never before. In it was the good nature
of the mob. It was no time to sit quietly at home and
enjoy a book&mdash;men and women must &quot;go somewhere,&quot;
they must &quot;do something.&quot; The women adopted the
Greek costume and appeared in simple white robes
<a name="II_Page_189"></a>caught at the shoulders with miniature stilettos. Many
men wore crape on their arms in pretended memory of
friends who had been kissed by Madame Guillotine.
There was fever in the air, fever in the blood, and the
passions held high carnival. In solitude, danger depresses
all save the very strongest, but the mob (ever the symbol
of weakness) is made up of women&mdash;it is an effeminate
thing. It laughs hysterically at death and cries, &quot;On
with the dance!&quot; Women represent the opposite poles
of virtue.</p>

<p>The fever continues: a &quot;poverty party&quot; is given by
Madame De Stael, where men dress in rags and
women wear tattered gowns that ill conceal their
charms. &quot;We must get used to it,&quot; she said, and everybody
laughed. Soon, men in the streets wear red nightcaps,
women appear in nightgowns, rich men wear
wooden shoes, and young men in gangs of twelve parade
the avenues at night carrying heavy clubs, hurrahing
for this or that.</p>

<p>Yes, society in Paris was never so gay.</p>

<p>The salons were crowded, and politics was the theme.
When the discussion waxed too warm, some one would
start a hymn and all would chime in until the contestants
were drowned out and in token of submission
joined in the chorus.</p>

<p>But Madame De Stael was very busy all these days.
Her house was filled with refugees, and she ran here and
there for passports and pardons, and beseeched ministers
<a name="II_Page_190"></a>and archbishops for interference or assistance or
amnesty or succor and all those things that great men
can give or bestow or effect or filch. And when her smiles
failed to win the wished-for signature, she still had tears
that would move a heart of brass.</p>

<p>About this time Baron De Stael fades from our vision,
leaving with Madame three children.</p>

<p>&quot;It was never anything but a 'mariage de convenance'
anyway, what of it ?&quot; and Madame bursts into tears
and throws herself into Farquar's arms.</p>

<p>&quot;Compose yourself, my dear&mdash;you are spoiling my
gown,&quot; says the Duchesse.</p>

<p>&quot;I stood him as long as I could,&quot; continued Madame.</p>

<p>&quot;You mean he stood you as long as he could.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You naughty thing!&mdash;why don't you sympathize with
me?&quot;</p>

<p>Then both women fall into a laughing fit that is interrupted
by the servant, who announces Benjamin
Constant.</p>

<p>Constant came as near winning the love of Madame De
Stael as any man ever did. He was politician, scholar,
writer, orator, courtier. But with it all he was a boor,
for when he had won the favor of Madame De Stael he
wrote a long letter to Madame Charriere, with whom he
had lived for several years in the greatest intimacy,
giving reasons why he had forsaken her, and ending
with an ecstacy in praise of the Stael.</p>

<p>If a man can do a thing more brutal than to humiliate
<a name="II_Page_191"></a>one woman at the expense of another, I do not know it.
And without entering any defense for the men who love
several women at one time, I wish to make a clear
distinction between the men who bully and brutalize
women for their own gratification and the men who find
their highest pleasure in pleasing women. The latter
may not be a paragon, yet as his desire is to give pleasure,
not to corral it, he is a totally different being from the
man who deceives, badgers, humiliates, and quarrels
with one who can not defend herself, in order that he
may find an excuse for leaving her.</p>

<p>A good many of Constant's speeches were written by
Madame De Stael, and when they traveled together
through Germany he no doubt was a great help to her
in preparing the &quot;De l'Allemagne.&quot;</p>

<p>But there was a little man approaching from out the
mist of obscurity who was to play an important part in
the life of Madame De Stael. He had heard of her wide-reaching
influence, and such an influence he could not
afford to forego&mdash;it must be used to further his ends.</p>

<p>Yet the First Consul did not call on her, and she did not
call on the First Consul. They played a waiting game,
&quot;If he wishes to see me, he knows that I am home
Thursdays!&quot; she said with a shrug.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, but a man in his position reverses the usual order:
he does not make the first call!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Evidently!&quot; said Madame, and the subject dropped
with a dull thud.</p>
<p><a name="II_Page_192"></a></p>
<p>Word came from somewhere that Baron De Stael was
seriously ill. The wife was thrown into a tumult of
emotion. She must go to him at once&mdash;a wife's duty was
to her husband first of all. She left everything, and
hastening to his bedside, there ministered to him
tenderly. But death claimed him. The widow returned
to Paris clothed in deep mourning. Crape was tied on
the door-knocker and the salon was closed.</p>

<p>The First Consul sent condolences.</p>

<p>&quot;The First Consul is a joker,&quot; said Dannion solemnly,
and took snuff.</p>

<p>In six weeks the salon was again opened. Not long after,
at a dinner, Napoleon and Madame De Stael sat side
by side. &quot;Your father was a great man,&quot; said Napoleon.</p>

<p>He had gotten in the first compliment when she had
planned otherwise. She intended to march her charms
in a phalanx upon him, but he would not have it so.
Her wit fell flat and her prettiest smile brought only
the remark, &quot;If the wind veers north it may rain.&quot;</p>

<p>They were rivals&mdash;that was the trouble. France was not
big enough for both.</p>

<p>Madame De Stael's book about Germany had been duly
announced, puffed, printed. Ten thousand copies were
issued and&mdash;seized upon by Napoleon's agents and
burned.</p>

<p>&quot;The edition is exhausted,&quot; cried Madame,
as she smiled through her tears and searched for her
pocket-handkerchief.</p>

<p>The trouble with the book was that nowhere in it was
<a name="II_Page_193"></a>Napoleon mentioned. Had Napoleon never noticed the
book, the author would have been woefully sorry. As it
was she was pleased, and when the last guest had gone
she and Benjamin Constant laughed, shook hands, and
ordered lunch.</p>

<p>But it was not so funny when Fouche called, apologized,
coughed, and said the air in Paris was bad.</p>

<p>So Madame De Stael had to go&mdash;it was &quot;Ten Years of
Exile.&quot; In that book you can read all about it. She
retired to Coppet, and all the griefs, persecutions, disappointments
and heartaches were doubtless softened
by the inward thought of the distinction that was hers
in being the first woman banished by Napoleon and of
being the only woman he thoroughly feared.</p>

<p>When it came Napoleon's turn to go and the departure
for Elba was at hand, it will be remembered he bade
good-by personally to those who had served him so
faithfully. It was an affecting scene when he kissed his
generals and saluted the swarthy grenadiers in the same
way. When told of it Madame picked a petal or two
from her bouquet and said, &quot;You see, my dears, the
difference is this: while Judas kissed but one, the Little
Man kissed forty.&quot;</p>

<p>Napoleon was scarcely out of France before Madame
was back in Paris with all her books and wit and beauty.
An ovation was given the daughter of Necker such as
Paris alone can give.</p>

<p>But Napoleon did not stay at
Elba, at least not according to any accounts I have read.</p>
<p><a name="II_Page_194"></a></p>
<p>When word came that he was marching on Paris,
Madame hastily packed up her manuscripts and started
in hot haste for Coppet.</p>

<p>But when the eighty days had passed and the bugaboo
was safely on board the &quot;Bellerophon,&quot; she came back
to the scenes she loved so well and to what for her was
the only heaven&mdash;Paris.</p>

<p>She has been called a philosopher and a literary light.
But she was only socio-literary. Her written philosophy
does not represent the things she felt were true&mdash;simply
those things she thought it would be nice to say. She
cultivated literature, only that she might shine. Love,
wealth, health, husband, children&mdash;all were sacrificed
that she might lead society and win applause. No one
ever feared solitude more: she must have those about
her who would minister to her vanity and upon whom
she could shower her wit. As a type her life is valuable,
and in these pages that traverse the entire circle of
feminine virtues and foibles she surely must have a
place.</p>

<p>In her last illness she was attended daily by those
faithful subjects who had all along recognized her
sovereignty&mdash;in Society she was Queen. She surely won
her heart's desire, for to that bed from which she was
no more to rise, courtiers came and kneeling kissed her
hand, and women by the score whom she had befriended
paid her the tribute of their tears.</p>

<p>She died in Paris aged fifty-one.</p>
<p><a name="II_Page_195"></a></p>
<hr />

<p>When you are in Switzerland and take the
little steamer that plies on Lake Leman from
Lausanne to Geneva, you will see on the
western shore a tiny village that clings close
around a chateau, like little oysters around the parent
shell. This is the village of Coppet that you behold, and
the central building that seems to be a part of the very
landscape is the Chateau De Necker. This was the home
of Madame De Stael and the place where so many
refugees sought safety.</p>

<p>&quot;Coppet is Hell in motion,&quot; said Napoleon. &quot;The
woman who lives there has a petticoat full of arrows
that could hit a man were he seated on a rainbow.
She combines in her active head and strong heart
Rousseau and Mirabeau; and then shields herself
behind a shift and screams if you approach. To attract
attention to herself she calls, 'Help, help!'&quot;</p>

<p>The man who voiced these words was surely fit rival to
the chatelaine of this vine-covered place of peace that
lies smiling an ironical smile in the sunshine on yonder
hillside.</p>

<p>Coppet bristles with history.</p>

<p>Could Coppet speak it must tell of Voltaire and Rousseau,
who had knocked at its gates; of John Calvin; of
Montmorency; of Hautville (for whom Victor Hugo
named a chateau); of Fanny Burney and Madame
Recamier and Girardin (pupil of Rousseau); and
Lafayette and hosts of others who are to us but names,
<a name="II_Page_196"></a>but who in their day were greatest among all the sons
of men.</p>

<p>Chief of all was the great Necker, who himself planned
and built the main edifice that his daughter &quot;might
ever call it home.&quot; Little did he know that it would
serve as her prison, and that from here she would have
to steal away in disguise. But yet it was the place she
called home for full two decades. Here she wrote and
wept and laughed and sang: hating the place when here,
loving it when away. Here she came when De Stael had
died, and here she brought her children. Here she
received the caresses of Benjamin Constant, and here
she won the love of pale, handsome Rocco, and here,
&quot;when past age,&quot; gave birth to his child. Here and in
Paris, in quick turn, the tragedy and comedy of her life
were played; and here she sleeps.</p>

<p>In the tourist season there are many visitors at the
chateau. A grave old soldier, wearing on his breast the
Cross of the Legion of Honor, meets you at the lodge
and conducts you through the halls, the salon and the
library. There are many family portraits, and mementos
without number, to bring back the past that is gone
forever. Inscribed copies of books from Goethe and
Schiller and Schlegel and Byron are in the cases, and
on the walls are to be seen pictures of Necker, Rocco,
De Stael and Albert, the firstborn son, decapitated in a
duel by a swinging stroke from a German saber, on
account of a king and two aces held in his sleeve.</p>
<p><a name="II_Page_197"></a></p>
<p>Beneath the old chateau dances a mountain brook, cold
from the Jura; in the great courtway is a fountain and
fish-pond, and all around are flowering plants and
stately palms. All is quiet and orderly. No children
play, no merry voices call, no glad laughter echoes
through these courts. Even the birds have ceased to
sing.</p>

<p>The quaint chairs in the parlors are pushed back with
precision against the wall, and the funereal silence that
reigns supreme seems to say that death yesterday came,
and an hour ago all the inmates of the gloomy mansion,
save the old soldier, followed the hearse afar and have
not yet returned.</p>

<p>We are conducted out through the garden, along gravel
walks, across the well-trimmed lawn; and before a high
iron gate, walled in on both sides with massive masonry,
the old soldier stops, and removes his cap. Standing
with heads uncovered, we are told that within rests the
dust of Madame De Stael, her parents, her children,
and her children's children&mdash;four generations in all.</p>

<p>The steamer whistles at the wharf as if to bring us
back from dream and mold and death, and we hasten
away, walking needlessly fast, looking back furtively
to see if grim spectral shapes are following after.
None is seen, but we do not breathe freely until aboard
the steamer and two short whistles are heard, and
the order is given to cast off. We push off slowly
from the stone pier, and all is safe.

<p>The Mennonite, Dunkard, Shaker,
Oneida Communist, Mormon and
Quaker are all one people, varying
only according to environment.</p>

<p>They are all Come-Outers.</p>

<p>They turn to plain clothes, hard
work, religious thought, eschewing
the pomps and vanities of the world&mdash;all
for the same reasons. Scratch any one of them and
you will find the true type. The monk of the Middle
Ages was the same man, his peculiarity being an extreme
asceticism that caused him to count sex a mistake on the
part of God. And this same question has been a stumbling-block
for ages to the type we now have under the
glass. A man who gives the question of sex too much
attention is very apt either to have no wife at all or else
four or five. If a Franciscan friar of the olden time
happened to glance at a clothesline on which, gaily
waving in the wanton winds, was a smock-frock, he
wore peas in his sandals for a month and a day.</p>

<p>The Shaker does not count women out because the
founder of the sect was a woman, but he is a complete
celibate and depends on Gentiles to populate the earth.
The Dunkard quotes Saint Paul and marries because he
must, but regards romantic love as a thing of which
Deity is jealous, and also a bit ashamed. The Oneida
<a name="II_Page_204"></a>Community clung to the same thought, and to obliterate
selfishness held women in common, tracing pedigree,
after the manner of ancient Sparta, through the female
line, because there was no other way. The Mormon
incidentally and accidentally adopted polygamy.</p>

<p>The Quakers have for the best part looked with disfavor
on passionate love. In the worship of Deity they
separate women from men. But all oscillations are
equalized by swingings to the other side. The Quakers
have often discarded a distinctive marriage-ceremony,
thus slanting toward natural selection. And I might
tell you of how in one of the South American States
there is a band of Friends who have discarded the rite
entirely, making marriage a private and personal contract
between the man and the woman&mdash;a sacred matter
of conscience; and should the man and woman find after
a trial that their mating was a mistake, they are as free
to separate as they were to marry, and no obloquy is
attached in any event. Harriet Martineau, Quaker in
sympathy, although not in name, being an independent
fighter armed with a long squirrel-rifle of marvelous
range and accuracy, pleaded strongly and boldly for a
law that would make divorce as free and simple as
marriage. Harriet once called marriage a mouse-trap,
and thereby sent shivers of surprise and indignation up
a bishop's back.</p>

<p>But there is one thing among all these quasi-ascetic
sects that has ever been in advance of the great mass of
<a name="II_Page_205"></a>humanity from which they are detached parts: they
have given woman her rights; whereas, the mass has
always prated, and does yet, mentioning it in statute
law, that the male has certain natural &quot;rights,&quot; and the
women only such rights as are granted her by the males.
And the reason of this wrong-headed attitude on part
of the mob is plain. It rules by force, whereas the semi-ascetic
sects decry force, using only moral suasion,
falling back on the Christ doctrine of non-resistance.
This has given their women a chance to prove that
they have just as able minds as the men, if not better.</p>

<p>That these non-resistants are the salt of the earth none
who know them can deny. It was the residents of the
monasteries in the Middle Ages who kept learning and
art from dying off the face of Europe. They built such
churches and performed such splendid work in art that
we are hushed into silence before the dignity of the
ruins of Melrose, Dryburgh and Furness. There are no
paupers among the Quakers, a &quot;criminal class&quot; is a
thing no Mennonite understands, no Dunkard is a
drunkard, the Oneida Communists were all well educated
and in dollars passing rich, while the Mormons
have accumulated wealth at the rate of over eleven
hundred dollars a man per year, which is more than
three times as good a record as can be shown by New
York or Pennsylvania. And further, until the Gentiles
bore down upon her, Utah had no use for either prisons,
asylums or almshouses. Until the Gentiles crowded into
<a name="II_Page_206"></a>Salt Lake City, there was no &quot;tenderloin district,&quot; no
&quot;dangerous class,&quot; no gambling &quot;dives.&quot; Instead,
there was universal order, industry, sobriety. It is well
to recognize the fact that the quasi-ascetic, possessed
of a religious idea, persecuted to a point that holds him
to his work, is the best type of citizen the world has
ever known. Tobacco, strong drink, and opium alternately
lull and excite, soothe and elevate, but always
destroy; yet they do not destroy our ascetic, for he
knows them not. He does not deplete himself by drugs,
rivalry, strife or anger. He believes in co-operation, not
competition. He works and prays. He keeps a good
digestion, an even pulse, a clear conscience; and as
man's true wants are very few, our subject grows rich
and has not only ample supplies for himself, but is
enabled to minister to others. He is earth's good
Samaritan. It was Tolstoy and his daughter who started
soup-houses in Russia and kept famine at bay. Your
true monk never passed by on the other side; ah, no!
the business of the old-time priest was to do good. The
Quaker is his best descendant&mdash;he is the true philanthropist.</p>

<p>If jeered, hooted and finally oppressed, these
protesters will form a clan or sect and adopt a distinctive
garb and speech. If persecuted, they will hold together,
as cattle on the prairies huddle against the storm. But
if left alone the Law of Reversion to Type catches the
second generation, and the young men and maidens
secrete millinery, just as birds do a brilliant plumage,
<a name="II_Page_207"></a>and the strange sect merges into and is lost in the mass.
The Jews did not say, Go to, we will be peculiar, but,
as Mr. Zangwill has stated, they have remained a
peculiar people simply because they have been proscribed.</p>

<p>The successful monk, grown rich and feeling secure,
turns voluptuary and becomes the very thing that he
renounced in his monastic vows. Over-anxious bicyclists
run into the object they wish to avoid. We are
attracted to the thing we despise; and we despise it
because it attracts. A recognition of this principle will
make plain why so many temperance fanatics are
really drunkards trying hard to keep sober. In us all is
the germ of the thing we hate; we become like the thing
we hate; we are the thing we hate. Ex-Quakers in Philadelphia,
I am told, are very dressy people. But before a
woman becomes a genuine admitted non-Quaker, the
rough, gray woolen dress shades off by almost imperceptible
degrees into a dainty silken lilac, whose generous
folds have a most peculiar and seductive rustle;
the bonnet becomes smaller, and pertly assumes a
becoming ruche, from under which steal forth daring,
winsome ringlets; while at the neck, purest of cream-white
kerchiefs jealously conceal the charms that a
mere worldly woman might reveal. Then the demi-monde,
finding themselves neglected, bribe the dressmakers
and adopt the costume.</p>

<p>Thus does civilization,
like the cyclone, move in spirals.</p>
<p><a name="II_Page_208"></a></p>
<hr />

<p>In a sermon preached at the City Temple,
June Eighteenth, Eighteen Hundred Ninety-six,
Doctor Joseph Parker said: &quot;There it
was&mdash;there! at Smithfield Market, a stone's
throw from here, that Ridley and Latimer were burned.
Over this spot the smoke of martyr fires hovered. And
I pray for a time when they will hover again. Aye, that
is what we need! the rack, the gallows, chains, dungeons,
fagots!&quot;</p>

<p>Yes, those are his words, and it was two days before
it came to me that Doctor Parker knew just what he
was talking about. Persecution can not stamp out
virtue, any more than man's effort can obliterate matter.
Man changes the form of things, but he does not
cancel their essence. And this is as true of the unseen
attributes of spirit as it is of the elements of matter.
Did the truths taught by Latimer and Ridley go out
with the flames that crackled about their limbs? Were
their names written for the last time in smoke? 'T were
vain to ask. The bishop who instigated their persecution
gave them certificates for immortality. But the
bishop did not know it&mdash;bishops who persecute know
not what they do.</p>

<p>Let us guess the result if Jesus had been eminently
successful, gathering about him, with the years, the
strong and influential men of Jerusalem! Suppose he
had fallen asleep at last of old age, and, full of honors,
been carried to his own tomb, patterned after that of
<a name="II_Page_209"></a>Joseph of Arimathea, but richer far&mdash;what then? And
if Socrates had apologized and had not drunk of the
hemlock, how about his philosophy, and would Plato
have written the &quot;Ph&aelig;do&quot;?</p>

<p>No religion is pure except in its state of poverty and
persecution; the good things of earth are our corrupters.
All life is from the sun, but fruit too well loved of the
sun falls first and rots. The religion that is fostered by
the State and upheld by a standing army may be a
pretty good religion, but it is not the Christ religion,
call you it &quot;Christianity&quot; never so loudly.</p>

<p>Martyr and persecutor are usually cut off the same
piece. They are the same type of man; and looking down
the centuries they seem to have shifted places easily.
As to which is persecutor and which is martyr is only
a question of transient power. They are constantly
teaching the trick to each other, just as scolding parents
have saucy children. They are both good people; their
sincerity can not be doubted. Marcus Aurelius, the
best emperor Rome ever had, persecuted the Christians;
while Caligula, Rome's worst emperor, didn't
know there were any Christians in his dominions, and
if he had known would not have cared.</p>

<p>The persecutor and the martyr both belong to the cultus
known as &quot;Muscular Christianity,&quot; the distinguishing
feature of which is a final appeal to force. We should,
however, respect it for the frankness of the name in
which it delights&mdash;Muscular Christianity being a totally
<a name="II_Page_210"></a>different thing from Christianity, which smitten turns
the other cheek.</p>

<p>But the Quaker, best type of the non-resistant quasi-ascetic,
is the exception that proves the rule; he may
be persecuted, but he persecutes not again. He is the
best authenticated type living of primitive Christian.
That the religion of Jesus was a purely reactionary
movement, suggested by the smug complacency and
voluptuous condition of the times, most thinking men
agree. Where rich Pharisees adopt a standard of life
that can only be maintained by devouring widows'
houses and oppressing the orphan, the needs of the
hour bring to the front a man who will swing the pendulum
to the other side. When society plays tennis
with truth, and pitch-and-toss with all the expressions
of love and friendship, certain ones will confine their
speech to yea, yea, and nay, nay. When men utter loud
prayers on street corners, some one will suggest that
the better way to pray is to retire to your closet and
shut the door. When self-appointed rulers wear purple
and scarlet and make broad their phylacteries, some
one will suggest that honest men had better adopt a
simplicity of attire. When a whole nation grows mad
in its hot endeavor to become rich, and the Temple of
the Most High is cumbered by the seats of money-changers,
already in some Galilean village sits a youth,
conscious of his Divine kinship, plaiting a scourge of
cords.</p>

<p>The gray garb of the Quaker is only a revulsion
<a name="II_Page_211"></a>from a flutter of ribbons and a towering headgear of
hues that shame the lily and rival the rainbow. Beau
Brummel, lifting his hat with great flourish to nobility
and standing hatless in the presence of illustrious nobodies,
finds his counterpart in William Penn, who was
born with his hat on and uncovers to no one. The height
of Brummel's hat finds place in the width of Penn's.</p>

<p>Quakerism is a protest against an idle, vain, voluptuous
and selfish life. It is the natural recoil from insincerity,
vanity and gormandism which, growing glaringly
offensive, causes these certain men and women
to &quot;come out&quot; and stand firm for plain living and high
thinking. And were it not for this divine principle in
humanity that prompts individuals to separate from
the mass when sensuality threatens to hold supreme
sway, the race would be snuffed out in hopeless night.
These men who come out effect their mission, not by
making all men Come-Outers, but by imperceptibly
changing the complexion of the mass. They are the
true and literal saviors of mankind.</p>

<p>Norwich has several things to recommend
it to the tourist, chief of which is the cathedral.
Great, massive, sullen structure&mdash;begun
in the Eleventh Century&mdash;it adheres more
closely to its Norman type than does any other building
in England.</p>

<p>Within sound of the tolling bells of this great cathedral,
aye, almost within the shadow of its turrets, was born,
in Seventeen Hundred Eighty, Elizabeth Gurney. Her
line of ancestry traced directly back to the De Gournays
who came with William the Conqueror, and laid the
foundations of this church and of England's civilization.
To the sensitive, imaginative girl this sacred
temple, replete with history, fading off into storied
song and curious legend, meant much. She haunted its
solemn transepts, and followed with eager eyes the
carved bosses on the ceiling, to see if the cherubs pictured
there were really alive. She took children from
the street and conducted them thither, explaining that
it was her grandfather who laid the mortar between
the stones and reared the walls and placed the splendid
colored windows, on which reflections of real angels
were to be seen, and where Madonnas winked when
the wind was east. And the children listened with open
mouths and marveled much, and this encouraged the
pale little girl with the wondering eyes, and she led
them to the tomb of Sir William Boleyn, whose granddaughter,
Anne Boleyn, used often to come here and
<a name="II_Page_213"></a>garland with flowers the grave above which our toddlers
talked in whispers, and where, yesterday, I, too,
stood.</p>

<p>And so Elizabeth grew in years and in stature and in
understanding; and although her parents were not members
of the Established Religion, yet a great cathedral
is greater than sect, and to her it was the true House
of Prayer. It was there that God listened to the prayers
of His children. She loved the place with an idolatrous
love and with all the splendid superstition of a child,
and thither she went to kneel and ask fulfilment of her
heart's desire. All the beauties of ancient and innocent
days moved radiant and luminous in the azure of her
mind. But time crept on and a woman's penetrating
comprehension came to her, and the dreams of youth
shifted off into the realities of maturity, and she saw
that many who came to pray were careless, frivolous
people, and that the vergers did their work without
more reverence than did the stablemen who cared for
her father's horses. And once when twilight was veiling
the choir, and all the worshipers had departed, she
saw a curate strike a match on the cloister-wall, to
light his pipe, and then with the rector laugh loudly,
because the bishop had forgotten and read his &quot;Te
Deum Laudamus&quot; before his &quot;Gloria in Excelsis.&quot;</p>

<p>By degrees it came to her that the lord bishop of this
holy place was in the employ of the State, and that the
State was master too of the army and the police and
<a name="II_Page_214"></a>the ships that sailed away to New Zealand, carrying
in their holds women and children, who never came
back, and men who, like the lord bishop, had forgotten
this and done that when they should have done the
other.</p>

<p>Once, in the streets of Norwich she saw a dozen men
with fetters riveted to their legs, all fastened to one
clanking chain, breaking stone in the drizzle of a winter
rain. And the thought came to her that the rich ladies,
wrapped in furs, who rolled by in their carriages, going
to the cathedral to pray, were no more God's children
than these wretches breaking stone from the darkness
of a winter morning until darkness settled over the
earth again at night.</p>

<p>She saw plainly the patent truth that, if some people
wore gaudy and costly raiment, others must dress in
rags; if some ate and drank more than they needed,
and wasted the good things of earth, others must go
hungry; if some never worked with their hands, others
must needs toil continuously.</p>

<p>The Gurneys were nominally Friends, but they had
gradually slipped away from the directness of speech,
the plainness of dress, and the simplicity of the Quakers.
They were getting rich on government contracts&mdash;and
who wants to be ridiculous anyway? So, with consternation,
the father and mother heard the avowal of
Elizabeth to adopt the extreme customs of the Friends.
They sought to dissuade her. They pointed out the
<a name="II_Page_215"></a>uselessness of being singular, and the folly of adopting
a mode of life that makes you a laughing-stock. But
this eighteen-year-old girl stood firm. She had resolved
to live the Christ-life and devote her energies to lessening
the pains of earth. Life was too short for frivolity;
no one could afford to compromise with evil. She became
the friend of children; the champion of the unfortunate;
she sided with the weak; she was their friend
and comforter. Her life became a cry in favor of the
oppressed, a defense of the downtrodden, an exaltation
of self-devotion, a prayer for universal sympathy,
liberty and light. She pleaded for the vicious, recognizing
that all are sinners and that those who do unlawful
acts are no more sinners in the eyes of God than we
who think them so.</p>

<p>The religious nature and sex-life are closely akin. The
woman possessing a high religious fervor is also capable
of a great and passionate love. But the Norwich Friends
did not believe in a passionate love, except as the work
of the devil. Yet this they knew, that marriage tames
a woman as nothing else can. They believed in religion,
of course&mdash;but not an absorbing, fanatical religion!
Elizabeth should get married&mdash;it would cure her mental
maladies: exaltation of spirit in a girl is a dangerous
thing anyway. Nothing subdues like marriage.</p>

<p>It may not be generally known, but your religious
ascetic is a great matchmaker. In all religious communities,
especially rural communities, men who need
<a name="II_Page_216"></a>wives need not advertise&mdash;there are self-appointed
committees of old ladies who advise and look after
such matters closely. The immanence of sex becomes
vicarious, and that which once dwelt in the flesh is
now a thought: like men-about-town, whose vices
finally become simply mental, so do these old ladies
carry on courtships by power of attorney.</p>

<p>And so the old ladies found a worthy Quaker man who
would make a good husband for Elizabeth. The man
was willing. He wrote a letter to her from his home in
London, addressing it to her father. The letter was
brief and businesslike. It described himself in modest
but accurate terms. He weighed ten stone and was five
feet eight inches high; he was a merchant with a goodly
income; and in disposition was all that was to be
desired&mdash;at least he said so. His pedigree was standard.</p>

<p>The Gurneys looked up this Mr. Fry, merchant,
of London, and found all as stated. He checked O.K.
He was invited to visit at Norwich; he came, he saw,
and was conquered. He liked Elizabeth, and Elizabeth
liked him&mdash;she surely did or she would never have
married him.</p>

<p>Elizabeth bore him twelve children. Mr. Fry was certainly
an excellent and amiable man. I find it recorded,
&quot;He never in any way hampered his wife's philanthropic
work,&quot; and with this testimonial to the excellence
of Mr. Fry's character we will excuse him from
these pages and speak only of his wife.</p>
<p><a name="II_Page_217"></a></p>
<p>Contrary to expectations, Elizabeth was not tamed by
marriage. She looked after her household with diligence;
but instead of confining her &quot;social duties&quot; to following
hotly after those in station above her, she sought
out those in the stratum beneath. Soon after reaching
London she began taking long walks alone, watching
the people, especially the beggars. The lowly and the
wretched interested her. She saw, girl though she was,
that beggardom and vice were twins.</p>

<p>In one of her daily walks, she noticed on a certain
corner a frowsled woman holding a babe, and thrusting
out a grimy hand for alms, telling a woeful tale of a dead
soldier husband to each passer-by. Elizabeth stopped
and talked with the woman. As the day was cold, she
took off her mittens and gave them to the beggar, and
went her way. The next day she again saw the woman
on the same corner and again talked with her, asking
to see the baby held so closely within the tattered
shawl. An intuitive glance (mother herself or soon to
be) told her that this sickly babe was not the child of
the woman who held it. She asked questions that the
woman evaded. Pressed further, the beggar grew
abusive, and took refuge in curses, with dire threats
of violence. Mrs. Fry withdrew, and waiting for nightfall
followed the woman: down a winding alley, past
rows of rotting tenements, into a cellar below a ginshop.
There, in this one squalid room, she found a dozen
babies, all tied fast in cribs or chairs, starving, or dying
<a name="II_Page_218"></a>of inattention. The woman, taken by surprise, did not
grow violent this time: she fled, and Mrs. Fry, sending
for two women Friends, took charge of the sufferers.</p>

<p>This sub-cellar nursery opened the eyes of Mrs. Fry
to the grim fact that England, professing to be Christian,
building costly churches, and maintaining an
immense army of paid priests, was essentially barbaric.
She set herself to the task of doing what she could
while life lasted to lessen the horror of ignorance and
sin.</p>

<p>Newgate Prison then, as now, stood in the center of
the city. It was necessary to have it in a conspicuous
place so that all might see the result of wrongdoing
and be good. Along the front of the prison were strong
iron gratings, where the prisoners crowded up to talk
with their friends. Through these gratings the unhappy
wretches called to strangers for alms, and thrust out
long wooden spoons for contributions, that would
enable them to pay their fines. There was a woman's
department; but if the men's department was too full,
men and women were herded together.</p>

<p>Mrs. Fry worked for her sex, so of these I will speak.
Women who had children under seven years of age
took them to prison with them; every week babes
were born there, so that at one time, in the year Eighteen
Hundred Twenty-six, we find there were one hundred
ninety women and one hundred children in Newgate.
There was no bedding. No clothing was supplied,
<a name="II_Page_219"></a>and those who had no friends outside to supply them
clothing were naked or nearly so, and would have been
entirely were it not for that spark of divinity which
causes the most depraved of women to minister to
one another. Women hate only their successful rivals.
The lowest of women will assist one another when
there is a dire emergency.</p>

<p>In this pen, awaiting trial, execution or transportation,
were girls of twelve to senile, helpless creatures of
eighty. All were thrust together. Hardened criminals,
besotted prostitutes, maidservants accused of stealing
thimbles, married women suspected of blasphemy,
pure-hearted, brave-natured girls who had run away
from brutal parents or more brutal husbands, insane
persons&mdash;all were herded together. All the keepers
were men. Patroling the walls were armed guards,
who were ordered to shoot all who tried to escape.
These guards were usually on good terms with the
women prisoners&mdash;hobnobbing at will. When the
mailed hand of government had once thrust these
women behind iron bars, and relieved virtuous society
of their presence, it seemed to think it had done its
duty. Inside, no crime was recognized save murder.
These women fought, overpowered the weak, stole
from and maltreated each other. Sometimes, certain
ones would combine for self-defense, forming factions.
Once, the Governor of the prison, bewigged, powdered,
lace-befrilled, ventured pompously into the women's
<a name="II_Page_220"></a>department without his usual armed guard; fifty hags
set upon him. In a twinkling his clothing was torn to
shreds too small for carpet-rags, and in two minutes
by the sand-glass, when he got back to the bars, lustily
calling for help, he was as naked as a cherub, even if
not as innocent.</p>

<p>Visitors who ventured near to the grating were often
asked to shake hands, and if once a grip was gotten
upon them the man was drawn up close, while long,
sinewy fingers grabbed his watch, handkerchief, neckscarf
or hat&mdash;all was pulled into the den. Sharp nailmarks
on the poor fellow's face told of the scrimmage,
and all the time the guards on the walls and the spectators
roared with laughter. Oh, it was awfully funny!</p>

<p>One woman whose shawl was snatched and sucked
into the maelstrom complained to the police, and was
told that folks inside of Newgate could not be arrested,
and that a good motto for outsiders was to keep away
from dangerous places.</p>

<p>Every morning at nine a curate read prayers at the
prisoners. The curate stood well outside the grating;
while all the time from inside loud cries of advice were
given and sundry remarks tendered him concerning
his personal appearance. The frightful hilarity of the
mob saved these wretches from despair. But the curate
did his duty: he who has ears to hear let him hear.
Waiting in the harbor were ships loading their freight
of sin, crime and woe for Botany Bay; at Tyburn every
<a name="II_Page_221"></a>week women were hanged. Three hundred offenses
were punishable with death; but, as in the West, where
horse-stealing is the supreme offense, most of the hangings
were for smuggling, forgery or shoplifting. England
being a nation of shopkeepers could not forgive offenses
that might injure a haberdasher.</p>

<p>Little Mrs. Fry, in the plainest of Quaker gray dress,
with bonnet to match, stood outside Newgate and
heard the curate read prayers. She resolved to ask the
Governor of the prison if she might herself perform
the office. The Governor was polite, but stated there
was no precedent for such an important move&mdash;he
must have time to consider. Mrs. Fry called again, and
permission was granted, with strict orders that she
must not attempt to proselyte, and, further, she had
better not get too near the grating.</p>

<p>Mrs. Fry gave the great man a bit of fright by quietly
explaining thus: &quot;Sir, if thee kindly allows me to pray
with the women, I will go inside.&quot;</p>

<p>The Governor asked her to say it again. She did so,
and a bright thought came to the great man: he would
grant her request, writing an order that she be allowed
to go inside the prison whenever she desired. It would
teach her a lesson and save him from further importunity.</p>

<p>So little Mrs. Fry presented the order, and the gates
were swung open and the iron quickly snapped behind
her. She spoke to the women, addressing the one who
<a name="II_Page_222"></a>seemed to be leader as sister, and asked the others to
follow her back into the courtway away from the
sound of the street, so they could have prayers. They
followed dumbly. She knelt on the stone pavement
and prayed in silence. Then she arose and read to them
the One Hundred Seventh Psalm. Again she prayed,
asking the others to kneel with her. A dozen knelt.
She arose and went her way amid a hush of solemn
silence.</p>

<p>Next day, when she came again, the ribaldry ceased
on her approach, and after the religious service she
remained inside the walls an hour conversing with
those who wished to talk with her, going to all the
children that were sick and ministering to them.</p>

<p>In a week she called all together and proposed starting
a school for the children. The mothers entered into
the project gladly. A governess, imprisoned for theft,
was elected teacher. A cell-room was cleaned out,
whitewashed, and set apart for a schoolroom, with the
permission of the Governor, who granted the request,
explaining, however, that there was no precedent for
such a thing. The school prospered, and outside the
schoolroom door hungry-eyed women listened furtively
for scraps of knowledge that might be tossed overboard.</p>

<p>Mrs. Fry next organized classes for these older children,
gray-haired, bowed with sin&mdash;many of them. There
were twelve in each class, and they elected a monitor
<a name="II_Page_223"></a>from their numbers, agreeing to obey her. Mrs. Fry
brought cloth from her husband's store, and the women
were taught to sew. The Governor insisted that there
was no precedent for it, and the guards on the walls
said that every scrap of cloth would be stolen, but the
guards were wrong.</p>

<p>The day was divided up into regular hours for work
and recreation. Other good Quaker women from outside
came in to help; and the taproom kept by a mercenary
guard was done away with, and an order established
that no spirituous liquors should be brought
into Newgate. The women agreed to keep away from
the grating on the street, except when personal friends
came; to cease begging; to quit gambling. They were
given pay for their labor. A woman was asked for as
turnkey, instead of a man. All guards were to be taken
from the walls that overlooked the women's department.
The women were to be given mats to sleep on,
and blankets to cover them when the weather was cold.
The Governor was astonished! He called a council of
the Lord Mayor and the Aldermen. They visited the
prison, and found for the first time that order had
come out of chaos at Newgate.</p>

<p>Mrs. Fry's requests were granted, and this little woman
awoke one morning to find herself famous.</p>

<p>From Newgate she turned her attention to other
prisons; she traveled throughout England, Scotland
and Ireland, visiting prisons and asylums. She became
<a name="II_Page_224"></a>well feared by those in authority, for her firm and gentle
glance went straight to every abuse. Often she was
airily turned away by some official clothed in a little
brief authority, but the man usually lived to know his
mistake.</p>

<p>She was invited by the French Government to visit the
prisons of Paris and write a report, giving suggestions
as to what reforms should be made. She went to
Belgium, Holland and Germany, being received by
kings and queens and prime ministers&mdash;as costume, her
plain gray dress always sufficing. She treated royalty
and unfortunates alike&mdash;simply as equals. She kept
constantly in her mind the thought that all men are
sinners before God: there are no rich, no poor; no high,
no low; no bond, no free. Conditions are transient, and
boldly did she say to the King of France that he should
build prisons with the idea of reformation, not revenge,
and with the thought ever before him that he himself
or his children might occupy these cells&mdash;so vain are
human ambitions. To Sir Robert Peel and his Cabinet
she read the story concerning the gallows built by
Haman. &quot;Thee must not shut out the sky from the
prisoner; thee must build no dark cells&mdash;thy children
may occupy them,&quot; she said.</p>

<p>John Howard and others had sent a glimmering ray of
truth through the fog of ignorance concerning insanity.
The belief was growing that insane people were really
not possessed of devils after all. Yet still, the cell
<a name="II_Page_225"></a>system, strait jacket and handcuffs were in great demand.
In no asylum were prisoners allowed to eat at tables.
Food was given to each in tin basins, without spoons,
knives or forks. Glass dishes and china plates were
considered especially dangerous; they told of one man
who in an insane fit had cut his throat with a plate, and
of another who had swallowed a spoon.</p>

<p>Visiting an asylum at Worcester, Mrs. Fry saw the
inmates receive their tin dishes, and, crouched on the
floor, eating like wild beasts. She asked the chief warden
for permission to try an experiment. He dubiously
granted it. With the help of several of the inmates she
arranged a long table, covered it with spotless linen
brought by herself, placed bouquets of wild flowers on
the table, and set it as she did at her own home. Then
she invited twenty of the patients to dinner. They came,
and a clergyman, who was an inmate, was asked to say
grace. All sat down, and the dinner passed off as quietly
and pleasantly as could be wished.</p>

<p>And these were the reforms she strove for, and put into
practical execution everywhere. She asked that the
word asylum be dropped, and home or hospital used
instead. In visiting asylums, by her presence she said
to the troubled spirits, Peace, be still! For half a century
she toiled with an increasing energy and a never-flagging
animation. She passed out full of honors, beloved
as woman was never yet loved&mdash;loved by the unfortunate,
the deformed, the weak, the vicious. She worked
<a name="II_Page_226"></a>for a present good, here and now, believing that we can
reach the future only through the present. In penology
nothing has been added to her philosophy, and we have
as yet not nearly carried out her suggestions.</p>

<p>Generation after generation will come and go, nations
will rise, grow old, and die, kings and rulers will be
forgotten, but so long as love kisses the white lips of
pain will men remember and revere the name of
Elizabeth Fry, Friend of Humanity.</p>

<p><br /><a name="II_Page_230"></a><a name="II_Page_231"></a></p>

<p>I sing the love of brother and sister.
For he who tells the tale of Charles
and Mary Lamb's life must tell of a
love that was an uplift to this
brother and sister in childhood, that
sustained them in the desolation of
disaster, and was a saving solace
even when every hope seemed gone
and reason veiled her face.</p>

<p>This love caused the flowers of springtime to bloom for
them again and again, and attracted such a circle of
admirers that, as we read the records of their lives, set
forth in the letters they received and wrote, we forget
poverty, forget calamity, and behold only the radiant,
smiling faces of loving, trusting, trustful friends.</p>

<p>The mother of Charles and Mary Lamb was a woman of
fine natural endowment, of spirit and of aspiration. She
married a man much older than herself. We know but
little about John Lamb; we know nothing of his ancestry.
Neither do we care to. He was not good enough to
attract, nor bad enough to be interesting. He called
himself a scrivener, but in fact he was a valet. He was
neutral salts; and I say this just after having read his
son's amiable mention of him under the guise of
&quot;Lovel,&quot; and with the full knowledge also that &quot;he
danced well, was a good judge of vintage, played the
<a name="II_Page_232"></a>harpsichord, and recited poetry on occasion.&quot;</p>

<p>When
a woman of spirit stands up before a priest and makes
solemn promise to live with a man who plays the
harpsichord and is a good judge of vintage, and to love
until either he or she dies, she sows the seeds of death
and disorder. Of course, I know that men and women
who make promises before priests know not at the time
what they do; they find out afterwards.</p>

<p>And so they were married, were John Lamb and Elizabeth
Field; and probably very soon thereafter Elizabeth
had a premonition that this union only held in store a
glittering blade of steel for her heart. For she grew ill
and dispirited, and John found companionship at the
alehouse, and came stumbling home asking what the
devil was the reason his wife couldn't meet him with
a smile and a kiss and a' that, as a dutiful wife should!</p>

<p>Elizabeth began to live more and more within herself.
We often hear foolish men taunt women with inability
to keep secrets. But women who talk much often do
keep secrets&mdash;there are nooks in their hearts where the
sun never enters, and where those nearest them are
never allowed to look. More lives are blasted by secrecy
than by frankness&mdash;ay! a thousand times. Why should
such a thing as a secret ever exist? 'Tis preposterous,
and is proof positive of depravity. If you and I are to
live together, my life must be open as the ether and all
my thoughts be yours. If I keep back this and that,
you will find it out some day and suspect, with reason,
<a name="II_Page_233"></a>that I also keep back the other. Ananias and Sapphira
met death, not so much for simple untruthfulness as
for keeping something back.</p>

<p>Elizabeth Lamb sought to protect herself against an
unappreciative mate by secrecy (perhaps she had to),
and the habit grew until she kept secrets as a business&mdash;she
kept foolish little secrets. Did she get a letter from
her aunt, she read it in suggestive silence and then put
it in her pocket. If visitors called she never mentioned
it, and when the children heard of it weeks afterward
they marveled.</p>

<p>And so shy little Mary Lamb wondered what it was her
mother kept locked up in the bottom drawer of the
bureau, and Mary was told that children must not ask
questions&mdash;little girls should be seen and not heard.</p>

<p>At night, Mary would dream of the things that were
in that drawer, and sometimes great, big, black things
would creep out through the keyhole and grow bigger
and bigger until they filled the room so full that you
couldn't breathe, and then little Mary would cry aloud
and scream, and her father would come with a strap
that was kept on a nail behind the kitchen-door and
teach her better than to wake everybody up in the
middle of the night.</p>

<p>Yet Mary loved her mother, and sought in many ways
to meet her wishes, and all the time her mother kept
the bureau-drawer locked, and away somewhere on a
high shelf was hidden all tenderness&mdash;all the gentle,
<a name="II_Page_234"></a>loving words and the caresses which children crave.</p>

<p>And little Mary's life seemed full of troubles, and the
world a grievous place where everybody misunderstands
everybody else; and at nighttime she would often hide
her face in the pillow and cry herself to sleep.</p>

<p>But when she was ten years of age a great joy came into
her life&mdash;a baby brother came! And all the love in the
little girl's heart was poured out for the puny baby boy.
Babies are troublesome things, anyway, where folks are
awful poor and where there are no servants and the
mother is not so very strong. And so Mary became the
baby's own little foster-mother, and she carried him
about, and long before he could lisp a word she had told
him all the hopes and secrets of her heart, and he cooed
and laughed, and lying on the floor, kicked his heels in
the air and treated hope and love and ambition alike.</p>

<p>I can not find that Mary ever went to school. She
stayed at home and sewed, did housework, and took
care of the baby. All her learning came by absorption.
When the boy was three years old she taught him his
letters, and did it so deftly and well that he used to
declare he could always read&mdash;and this is as it should be.
When seven years of age the boy was sent to the Blue-Coat
School. This was brought about through the influence
of Mr. Salt, for whom John Lamb worked. Mr. Salt
was a Bencher, and be it known a Bencher in England
is not exactly the same thing as a Bencher in America.
Mr. Salt took quite a notion to little Mary Lamb, and
<a name="II_Page_235"></a>once when she came to his office with her father's
dinner, the honorable Bencher chucked her under the
chin, said she was a fine little girl, and asked her if she
liked to read. And when she answered, &quot;Oh, yes, sir!&quot;
and then added, &quot;If you please!&quot; the Bencher laughed,
and told her she was welcome to take any book in his
library. And so we find she spent many happy hours in
the great man's library; and it was through her importunities
that Mr. Salt got banty Charles the scholarship
in Christ's Hospital School.</p>

<p>Now the Blue-Coat boys are a curiosity to every sight-seer
in London&mdash;and have been for these hundred years
and more. Their long-tailed blue coats, buckle-shoes,
and absence of either hats or caps bring the Yankee up
with a halt. To conduct an American around to the
vicinity of Christ's Hospital and let him discover a
&quot;Blue-Coat&quot; for himself is a sensation. The costume
is exactly the same as that worn by Edward, &quot;the Boy
King,&quot; who founded the school; and these youngsters,
like the birds, never grow old. You lean against the
high iron fence, and looking through the bars watch
the boys frolic and play, just as visitors looked in the
Eighteenth Century; and I've never been by Christ's
Hospital yet when curious people did not stand and
stare. And one thing the Blue-Coats seem to prove,
and that is that hats are quite superfluous.</p>

<p>One worthy man from Jamestown, New York, was so
impressed by these hatless boys that he wrote a book
<a name="II_Page_236"></a>proving that the wearing of hats was what has kept the
race in bondage to ignorance all down the ages. By
statistics he proved that the Blue-Coats had attained
distinction quite out of ratio to their number, and cited
Coleridge, Leigh Hunt, Charles Lamb and many others
as proof. This man returned to Jamestown hatless, and
had he not caught cold and been carried off by pneumonia,
would have spread his hatless gospel, rendering
the name of Knox the Hatter infamous, and causing the
word &quot;Derby&quot; to be henceforth a byword and a hissing.</p>

<p>When little Charles Lamb tucked the tails of his long
blue coat under his belt and played leap-frog in the
school-yard every morning at ten minutes after 'leven,
his sister, wan, yellow and dreamy, used to come and
watch him through these selfsame iron bars. She would
wave the corner of her rusty shawl in loving token, and
he would answer back and would have lifted his hat if
he had had one. When the bell rang and the boys went
pellmell into the entry-way, Charles would linger and
hold one hand above his head as the stone wall swallowed
him, and the sister knowing that all was well
would hasten back to her work in Little Queen Street,
hard by, to wait for the morrow when she could come
again.</p>

<p>&quot;Who is that girl always hanging 'round after you?&quot;
asked a tall, handsome boy, called Ajax, of little
Charles Lamb.</p>

<p>&quot;Wh' why, don't you know&mdash;that, wh' why that's
<a name="II_Page_237"></a>my sister Mary!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;How should I know when you
have never introduced me!&quot; loftily replied Ajax.</p>

<p>And so the next day, at ten minutes after 'leven,
Charles and the mighty Ajax came down to the fence,
and Charles had to call to Mary not to run away, and
Charles introduced Ajax to Mary and they shook hands
through the fence. And the next week Ajax, who was
known in private life as Samuel Taylor Coleridge,
called at the house in Little Queen Street where the
Lambs lived, and they all had gin and water, and the
elder Lamb played the harpsichord, a secondhand one
that had been presented by Mr. Salt, and recited poetry,
and Coleridge talked the elder Lamb under the table
and argued the entire party into silence. Coleridge was
only seventeen then, but a man grown, and already took
snuff like a courtier, tapping the lid of the box meditatively
and flashing a conundrum the while on the
admiring company.</p>

<p>Mary kept about as close run of the Blue-Coat School
as if she had been a Blue-Coat herself. Still, she felt
it her duty to keep one lesson in advance of her brother,
just to know that he was progressing well.</p>

<p>He continued to go to school until he was fourteen,
when he was set to work in the South Sea Company's
office, because his income was needed to keep the
family. Mary was educating the boy with the help of
Mr. Salt's library, for a boy as fine as Charles must be
educated, you know. By and by the bubble burst, and
<a name="II_Page_238"></a>young Lamb was transferred to the East India Company's
office, and being promoted was making nearly a
hundred pounds a year.</p>

<p>And Mary sewed and borrowed books and toiled
incessantly, but was ill at times. People said her head
was not just right&mdash;she was overworked and nervous
or something! The father had lost his place on account
of too much gin and water, especially gin; the mother
was almost helpless from paralysis, and in the family
was an aged maiden aunt to be cared for. The only
regular income was the salary of Charles.</p>

<p>There they lived in their poverty and lowliness, hoping
for better things!</p>

<p>Charles was working away over the ledgers, and used to
come home fagged and weary, and Coleridge was far
away, and there was no boy to educate now, and only
sick and foolish and quibbling people on whom to
strike fire. The demnition grind did its work for Mary
Lamb as surely as it is today doing it for countless
farmers' wives in Iowa and Illinois.</p>

<p>Thus ran the years away.</p>

<p>Mary Lamb, aged thirty-two, gentle, intelligent and
wondrous kind, in sudden frenzy seized a knife from the
table and with one thrust sank the blade into her
mother's heart. Charles Lamb, in an adjoining room,
hearing the commotion, entered quickly and taking the
knife from his sister's hand, put his arm about her and
tenderly led her away.</p>
<p><a name="II_Page_239"></a></p>
<p>Returning in a few moments, the mother was dead.</p>

<p>Women often make a shrill outcry at sight of a
mouse; men curse roundly when large, buzzing, blue-bottle
flies disturb their after-dinner nap; but let
occasion come and the stuff of which heroes are made is in
us all. I think well of my kind.</p>

<p>Charles Lamb made no outcry, he shed no tears, he
spoke no word of reproach. He met each detail of that
terrible issue as coolly, calmly and surely as if he had
been making entries in his journal. No man ever loved
his mother more, but she was dead now&mdash;she was dead.
He closed the staring eyes, composed the stiffening
limbs, kept curious sightseers at bay, and all the time
thought of what he could do to protect the living&mdash;she
who had wrought this ruin.</p>

<p>Charles was twenty-one&mdash;a boy in feeling and temperament,
a frolicsome, heedless boy. In an hour he had
become a man.</p>

<p>It requires a subtler pen than mine to trace the psychology
of this tragedy; but let me say this much, it had
its birth in love, in unrequited love; and the outcome
of it was an increase in love.</p>

<p>O God! how wonderful are Thy works! Thou makest
the rotting log to nourish banks of violets, and from
the stagnant pool at Thy word springs forth the lotus
that covers all with fragrance and beauty!</p>
<p><a name="II_Page_240"></a></p>
<hr />
<p>Coleridge in his youth was brilliant&mdash;no
one disputes that. He dazzled Charles and
Mary Lamb from the very first. Even when a
Blue-Coat he could turn a pretty quatrain,
and when he went away to Cambridge and once in a
long while wrote a letter down to &quot;My Own C.L.,&quot;
it was a feast for the sister, too. Mary was different
from other girls: she didn't &quot;have company,&quot; she was
too honest and serious and earnest for society&mdash;her
ideals too high. Coleridge&mdash;handsome, witty, philosophic
Coleridge&mdash;was her ideal. She loved him from
afar.</p>

<p>How vain it is to ponder in our minds the what-might-have-been!
Yet how can we help wondering what would
have been the result had Coleridge wedded Mary Lamb!
In many ways it seems it would have been an ideal
mating, for Mary Lamb's mental dowry made good
Coleridge's every deficiency, and his merits equalized
all that she lacked. He was sprightly, headstrong,
erratic, emotional; she was equally keen-witted, but a
conservative in her cast of mind. That she was capable
of a great and passionate love there is no doubt, and he
might have been. Mary Lamb would have been his
anchor to win'ard, but as it was he drifted straight
on to the rocks. Her mental troubles came from a lack
of responsibility&mdash;a rusting away of unused powers in a
dull, monotonous round of commonplace. Had her
heart found its home I can not conceive of her in any
<a name="II_Page_241"></a>other light than as a splendid, earnest woman&mdash;sane,
well-poised, and doing a work that only the strong can
do. Coleridge has left on record the statement that she
was the only woman he ever met who had a &quot;logical
mind&quot;&mdash;that is to say, the only woman who ever
understood him when he talked his best.</p>

<p>Coleridge made progress at the Blue-Coat School: he
became &quot;Deputy Grecian,&quot; or head scholar. This
secured him a scholarship at Cambridge, and thither
he went in search of honors. But his revolutionary and
Unitarian principles did not serve him in good stead,
and he was placed under the ban.</p>

<p>At the same time a youth by the name of Robert
Southey was having a like experience at Oxford. Other
youths had tried in days agone to shake Cambridge
and Oxford out of their conservatism, and the result
was that the embryo revolutionists speedily found
themselves warned off the campus. So through sympathy
Coleridge and Southey met. Coleridge also
brought along a young philosopher and poet, who had
also been a Blue-Coat, by the name of Lovell.</p>

<p>These three young men talked philosophy, and came to
the conclusion that the world was wrong. They said
society was founded on a false hypothesis&mdash;they would
better things. And so they planned packing up and
away to America to found an Ideal Community on the
banks of the Susquehanna. But hold! a society without
women is founded on a false hypothesis&mdash;that's so&mdash;<a name="II_Page_242"></a>what
to do? Now in America there are no women but
Indian squaws.</p>

<p>But resource did not fail them&mdash;Southey thought of the
Fricker family, a mile out on the Bristol road. There
were three fine, strong, intelligent girls&mdash;what better
than to marry 'em? The world should be peopled from
the best. The girls were consulted and found willing to
reorganize society on the communal basis, and so the
three poets married the three sisters&mdash;more properly,
each of the three poets married a sister. &quot;Thank God,&quot;
said Lamb, &quot;that there were not four of those Fricker
girls, or I, too, would have been bagged, and the world
peopled from the best!&quot;</p>

<p>Southey got the only prize out of the hazard; Lovell's
wife was so-so, and Coleridge drew a blank, or thought
he did, which was the same thing; for as a man thinketh
so is she. The thought of a lifetime on the banks of the
Susquehanna with a woman who was simply pink and
good, and who was never roused into animation even by
his wildest poetic bursts, took all ambition out of him.</p>

<p>Funds were low and the emigration scheme was temporarily
pigeonholed. After a short time Coleridge
declared his mind was getting mildewed and packed off
to London for mental oxygen and a little visit, leaving
his wife in Southey's charge.</p>

<p>He was gone two years.</p>

<p>Lovell soon followed suit, and Southey had three
sisters in his household, all with babies.</p>
<p><a name="II_Page_243"></a></p>
<p>In the meantime we find Southey installed at &quot;Greta,&quot;
just outside of the interesting town of Keswick, where
the water comes down at Lodore. Southey was a general:
he knew that knowledge consists in having a clerk who
can find the thing. He laid out research work and literary
schemes enough for several lifetimes, and the three
sisters were hard at it. It was a little community of
their own&mdash;all working for Southey, and glad of it.
Wordsworth and his sister Dorothy lived at Grasmere,
thirteen miles away, and they used to visit back and
forth. When you go to Keswick you should tramp that
thirteen miles&mdash;the man who hasn't tramped from
Keswick to Grasmere has dropped something out of his
life. In merry jest, tipped with acid, some one called
them &quot;The Lake Poets,&quot; as if there were poets and
lake poets. And Lamb was spoken of as &quot;a Lake Poet
by grace.&quot; Literary London grinned, as we do when
some one speaks of the Sweet Singer of Michigan or the
Chicago Muse. But the term of contempt stuck and,
like the words Methodist, Quaker and Philistine, soon
ceased to be a term of reproach and became something
of which to be proud.</p>

<p>There is a lead-pencil factory at Keswick, established
in the year Eighteen Hundred. Pencils are made there
today exactly as they were made then, and when you
see the factory you are willing to believe it. All visitors
at Keswick go to the pencil-factory and buy pencils,
such as Southey used, and get their names stamped on
<a name="II_Page_244"></a>each pencil while they wait, without extra charge. On
the wall is a silhouette picture of Southey, showing a
needlessly large nose, and the gentlemanly old proprietor
will tell you that Dorothy Wordsworth made
the picture; and then he will show you a letter written
by Charles Lamb, framed under glass, wherein C.L.
says all pencils are fairish good, but no pencils are so
good as Keswick pencils.</p>

<p>For a while, when times were hard, Coleridge's wife
worked here making pencils, while her archangel
husband (a little damaged) went with Wordsworth to
study metaphysics at Gottingen. When Coleridge came
back and heard what his wife had done, he reproved
her&mdash;gently but firmly. Mrs. Ajax in a pencil-factory
wearing a check apron with a bib!&mdash;huh!!</p>

<p>Southey had concluded that if Coleridge and Lovell
were good samples of socialism he would stick to individualism.
So he joined the Church of England, became
a Monarchist, sang the praises of royalty, got a pension,
became Poet Laureate, and rich&mdash;passing rich.</p>

<p>&quot;Wh-wh-when he secured for himself the services of
three good women he made a wise move,&quot; said C.L.</p>

<p>And all the time Coleridge and Lamb were in correspondence:
and when Coleridge was in London he
kept close run of the Lambs. The father and old aunt
had passed out, and Charles and Mary lived together
in rooms. They seemed to have moved very often&mdash;their
record followed them. When the other tenants
<a name="II_Page_245"></a>heard that &quot;she's the one that killed her mother,&quot;
they ceased to let their children play in the hallways,
and the landlord apologized, coughed, and raised the
rent. Poor Charles saw the point and did not argue it.
He looked for other lodgings and having found 'em
went home and said to Mary, &quot;It's too noisy here.
Sister&mdash;I can't stand it&mdash;we'll have to go!&quot;</p>

<p>Charles was a literary man now: a bookkeeper by day
and a literary man by night. He wrote to please his
sister, and all his jokes were for her. There is a genuine
vein of pathos in all true humor, but think of the fear
and the love and the tenderness that are concealed in
Charles Lamb's work that was designed only to fight
off dread calamity! And Mary copied and read and
revised for her brother, and he told it all to her before
he wrote it, and together they discussed it in detail.
Charles studied mathematics, just to keep his genius
under, he declared. Mary smiled and said it wasn't
necessary.</p>

<p>Coleridge used to drop in, and the Stoddarts, Hazlitts,
Godwin and Lovell, too. Then Southey was up in
London and he called, and so did Wordsworth and
Dorothy, for Coleridge had spread Lamb's fame. And
Dorothy and Mary kissed each other and held hands
under the table, and when Dorothy went back to Grasmere
she wrote many beautiful letters to Mary and
urged her to come and visit her&mdash;yes, come to Grasmere
and live. The one point they held in common was
<a name="II_Page_246"></a>a love for Coleridge; and as he belonged to neither there
was no room for jealousy. The Fricker girls were all
safely married, but Charles and Mary could not think
of going&mdash;they needs must hide in a big city. &quot;I hate
your damned throstles and larks and bobolinks,&quot; said
C.L., in feigned contempt. &quot;I sing the praises of the
'Salutation and the Cat' and a snug fourth-floor back.&quot;</p>

<p>They could not leave London, for over them ever
hung that black cloud of a mind diseased.</p>

<p>&quot;I can do nothing&mdash;think nothing. Mary has another
of her bad spells&mdash;we saw it coming, and I took her
away to a place of safety,&quot; writes Charles to Coleridge.</p>

<p>One writer tells of seeing Charles and Mary walking
across Hampstead Heath, hand in hand, both crying.
They were on the way to the asylum.</p>

<p>Fortunately these &quot;illnesses&quot; gave warning and
Charles would ask his employer leave for a &quot;holiday,&quot;
and stay at home trying by gentle mirth and work to
divert the dread visitor of unreason.</p>

<p>After each illness, in a few weeks the sister would be
restored to her own, very weak and her mind a blank
as to what had gone before. And so she never remembered
that supreme calamity. She knew the deed had
been done, but Heaven had absolved her gentle spirit
from all participation in it. She often talked of her
mother, wrote of her, quoted her, and that they should
sometime be again united was her firm faith.</p>

<p>The &quot;Tales from Shakespeare&quot; was written at the
<a name="II_Page_247"></a>suggestion of Godwin, seconded by Charles. The idea
that she herself could write seemed never to have
occurred to Mary, until Charles swore with a needless
oath that all the ideas he ever had she supplied.</p>

<p>&quot;Charles, dear, you've been drinking again!&quot; said
Mary. But the &quot;Tales&quot; sold and sold well; fame came
that way and more money than the simple, plain,
homekeeping bodies needed. So they started a pension-roll
for sundry old ladies, and to themselves played high
and mighty patron, and figured and talked and joked
over the blue teacups as to what they should do with
their money&mdash;five hundred pounds a year! Goodness
gracious, if the Bank of England gets in a pinch advise
C.L., at Thirty-four Southampton Buildings, third
floor, second turning to the left but one.</p>

<p>A Mrs. Reynolds was one of the pensioners, but no one
knew it but Mrs. Reynolds, and she never told. She
was a Lady of the Old School, and used often to dine
with the Lambs and get her snuffbox filled. Her husband
had been a ship-captain or something, and when
the tea was strong she would take snuff and tell the
visitors about him and swear she had ever been true
to his memory, though God knows all good-looking
and clever widows are sorely tried in this scurvy world!</p>

<p>Mrs. Reynolds met Thomas Hood at a &quot;Saturday
Evening&quot; at the Lambs', and he was so taken with her
that he has told us &quot;she looked like an elderly wax doll
in half-mourning, and when she spoke it was as if by
<a name="II_Page_248"></a>an artificial process; she always kept up the gurgle
and buzz until run down.&quot;</p>

<p>Mrs. Reynolds' sole claim to literary distinction was the
fact that she had known Goldsmith and he had presented
her with an inscribed copy of &quot;The Deserted
Village.&quot;</p>

<p>But we all have a tender place in our hearts for the
elderly wax doll because the Lambs were so gentle and
patient with her, and once a year went to Highgate
and put a shilling vase of flowers over the grave of the
Captain to whose memory she was ever true.</p>

<p>These friendless old souls used to meet and mix at the
Lambs' with those whose names are now deathless.
You can not write the history of English Letters and
leave the Lambs out. They were the loved and loving
friends of Southey, Wordsworth, Coleridge, De Quincey,
Jeffrey and Godwin. They won the recognition of all
who prize the far-reaching intellect&mdash;the subtle imagination.
The pathos and tenderness of their lives entwine
us with tendrils that hold our hearts in thrall.</p>

<p>They adopted a little girl, a beautiful little girl by the
name of Emma Isola. And never was there child that
was a greater joy to parents than was Emma Isola to
Charles and Mary. The wonder is they did not spoil
her with admiration, and by laughing at all her foolish
little pranks. Mary set herself the task of educating
this little girl, and formed a class the better to do it&mdash;a
class of three: Emma Isola, William Hazlitt's son and
<a name="II_Page_249"></a>Mary Victoria Novello. I met Mary Victoria once; she's
over eighty years of age now. Her form is a little bent,
but her eye is bright and her smile is the smile of youth.
Folks call her Mary Cowden-Clarke.</p>

<p>And I want you to remember, dearie, that it was Mary
Lamb who introduced the other Mary to Shakespeare,
by reading to her the manuscript of the &quot;Tales.&quot; And
further, that it was the success of the &quot;Tales&quot; that
fired Mary Cowden-Clarke with an ambition also to
do a great Shakespearian work. There may be a question
about the propriety of calling the &quot;Tales&quot; a great
work&mdash;their simplicity seems to forbid it&mdash;but the term
is all right when applied to that splendid life-achievement,
the &quot;Concordance,&quot; of which Mary Lamb was
the grandmother.</p>

<p>Emma Isola married Edward Moxon, and the Moxon
home was the home of Mary Lamb whenever she wished
to make it so, to the day of her death. The Moxons did
good by stealth, and were glad they never awoke and
found it fame.</p>

<p>&quot;What shall I do when Mary leaves me, never to
return?&quot; once said Charles to Manning. But Mary
lived for full twenty years after Charles had gone, and
lived only in loving memory of him who had devoted
his life to her. She seemed to exist just to talk of him
and to garland the grave in the little old churchyard
at Edmonton, where he sleeps. Wordsworth says, &quot;A
grave is a tranquillizing object: resignation in time
<a name="II_Page_250"></a>springs up from it as naturally as wild flowers bespread
the turf.&quot; Her work was to look after the &quot;pensioners&quot;
and carry out the wishes of &quot;my brother Charles.&quot;</p>

<p>But the pensioners were laid away to rest, one after the
other, and the gentle Mary, grown old and feeble,
became a pensioner, too, but thanks to that divine
humanity that is found in English hearts, she never
knew it. To the last, she looked after &quot;the worthy
poor,&quot; and carried flowers once a year to the grave of
the gallant Captain Reynolds at Highgate, and never
tired of sounding the praises of Charles and excusing
the foibles of Coleridge. She lived only in the past, and
its loving memories were more than a ballast 'gainst the
ills of the present.</p>

<p>And so she went down into the valley and entered the
great shadow, telling in cheerful, broken musings of a
brother's love.</p>

<p>And then she was carried to the churchyard at Edmonton.
There she rests in the grave with her brother. In
life they were never separated, and in death they are
not divided.</p>

<p>It was at Cambridge, England, I
met him&mdash;a fine, intelligent clergyman
he was, too.</p>

<p>&quot;He's not a 'Varsity man,&quot; said
my new acquaintance, speaking of
Doctor Joseph Parker, the world's
greatest preacher. &quot;If he were, he
wouldn't do all these preposterous
things, you know.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;He's a little like Henry Irving,&quot; I ventured apologetically.</p>

<p>&quot;True, and what absurd mannerisms&mdash;did you ever
see the like! Yes, one's from Yorkshire and the other's
from Cornwall, and both are Philistines.&quot;</p>

<p>He laughed at his little joke and so did I, for I always
try to be polite.</p>

<p>So I went my way, and as I strolled it came to me that
my clerical friend was right&mdash;a university course might
have taken all the individuality out of these strong men
and made of their genius a purely neutral decoction.
And when I thought further and considered how much
learning has done to banish wisdom, it was a satisfaction
to remember that Shakespeare at Oxford did
nothing beyond making the acquaintance of an inn-keeper's
wife.</p>

<p>It hardly seems possible that a Harvard degree would
<a name="II_Page_256"></a>have made a stronger man of Abraham Lincoln; or that
Edison, whose brain has wrought greater changes than
that of any other man of the century, was the loser by
not being versed in physics as taught at Yale.</p>

<p>The Law of Compensation never rests, and the men
who are taught too much from books are not taught by
Deity. Most education in the past has failed to awaken
in its subject a degree of intellectual consciousness. It
is the education that the Jesuits served out to the
Indian. It made him peaceable, but took all dignity out
of him. From a noble red man he descended into a dirty
Injun, who signed away his heritage for rum.</p>

<p>The world's plan of education has mostly been priestly&mdash;we
have striven to inculcate trust and reverence. We
have cited authorities and quoted precedents and given
examples: it was a matter of memory; while all the
time the whole spiritual acreage was left untilled.</p>

<p>A race educated in this way never advances, save as
it is jolted out of its notions by men with either a sublime
ignorance of, or an indifference to, what has been
done and said. These men are always called barbarians
by their contemporaries: they are jeered and hooted.
They supply much mirth by their eccentricities. After
they are dead the world sometimes canonizes them and
carves on their tombs the word &quot;Savior.&quot;</p>

<p>Do I then plead the cause of ignorance? Well, yes,
rather so. A little ignorance is not a dangerous thing.
A man who reads too much&mdash;who accumulates too
<a name="II_Page_257"></a>many facts-gets his mind filled to the point of saturation;
matters then crystallize and his head becomes a
solid thing that refuses to let anything either in or out.
In his soul there is no guest-chamber. His only hope
for progress lies in another incarnation.</p>

<p>And so a certain ignorance seems a necessary equipment
for the doing of a great work. To live in a big city
and know what others are doing and saying; to meet
the learned and powerful, and hear their sermons and
lectures; to view the unending shelves of vast libraries is
to be discouraged at the start. And thus we find that
genius is essentially rural&mdash;a country product. Salons,
soirees, theaters, concerts, lectures, libraries, produce
a fine mediocrity that smiles at the right time and bows
when 't is proper, but it is well to bear in mind that
George Eliot, Elizabeth Barrett, Charlotte Bronte and
Jane Austen were all country girls, with little companionship,
nourished on picked-up classics, having a
healthy ignorance of what the world was saying and
doing.</p>
<p><a name="II_Page_258"></a></p>
<hr />
<p>It is over a hundred years since Jane Austen
lived. But when you tramp that five miles
from Overton, where the railroad-station is,
to Steventon, where she was born, it doesn't
seem like it. Rural England does not change much.
Great fleecy clouds roll lazily across the blue, overhead,
and the hedgerows are full of twittering birds that you
hear but seldom see; and the pastures contain mild-faced
cows that look at you with wide-open eyes over
the stone walls; and in the towering elm-trees that
sway their branches in the breeze crows hold a noisy
caucus. And it comes to you that the clouds and the
blue sky and the hedgerows and the birds and the cows
and the crows are all just as Jane Austen knew them&mdash;no
change. These stone walls stood here then, and so
did the low slate-roofed barns and the whitewashed
cottages where the roses clamber over the doors.</p>

<p>I paused in front of one of these snug, homely, handsome,
pretty little cottages and looked at the two exact
rows of flowers that lined the little walk leading from
gate to cottage-door. The pathway was made from
coal-ashes and the flowerbeds were marked off with
pieces of broken crockery set on edge. 'T was an absent-minded,
impolite thing to do&mdash;to stand leaning on a
gate and critically examine the landscape-gardening,
evidently an overworked woman's gardening, at that.</p>

<p>As I leaned there the door opened and a little woman
with sleeves rolled up appeared. I mumbled an apology,
<a name="II_Page_259"></a>but before I could articulate it, she held out a pair of
scissors and said, &quot;Perhaps, sir, you'd like to clip some
of the flowers&mdash;the roses over the door are best!&quot;</p>

<p>Three children hung to her skirts, peeking, round faces
from behind, and quite accidentally disclosing a very
neat ankle.</p>

<p>I took the scissors and clipped three splendid Jacqueminots
and said it was a beautiful day. She agreed with
me and added that she was just finishing her churning
and if I'd wait a minute until the butter came, she'd
give me a drink of buttermilk.</p>

<p>I waited without urging and got the buttermilk, and
as the children had come out from hiding I was minded
to give them a penny apiece. Two coppers were all I
could muster, so I gave the two boys each a penny and
the little girl a shilling. The mother protested that she
had no change and that a bob was too much for a little
girl like that, but I assumed a Big-Bonanza air and
explained that I was from California where the smallest
change is a dollar.</p>

<p>&quot;Go thank the gentleman, Jane.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That's right, Jane Austen, come here and thank me!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;How did you know her name was Jane Austen&mdash;Jane
Austen Humphreys?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I didn't know&mdash;I only guessed.&quot;</p>

<p>Then little Mrs. Humphreys ceased patting the butter
and told me that she named her baby girl for Jane
Austen, who used to live near here a long time ago.
<a name="II_Page_260"></a>Jane Austen was one of the greatest writers that ever
lived&mdash;the Rector said so. The Reverend George Austen
preached at Steventon for years and years, and I
should go and see the church&mdash;the same church where
he preached and where Jane Austen used to go. And
anything I wanted to know about Jane Austen's books
the Rector could tell, for he was a wonderful learned
man was the Rector&mdash;&quot;Kiss the gentleman, Jane.&quot;</p>

<p>So I kissed Jane Austen's round, rosy cheek and stroked
the tousled heads of the boys by way of blessing, and
started for Steventon to interview the Rector who was
very wise.</p>

<p>And the clergyman who teaches his people the history
of their neighborhood, and tells them of the excellent
men and women who once lived thereabouts, is both
wise and good. And the present Rector at Steventon
is both&mdash;I'm sure of that.</p>
<p><a name="II_Page_261"></a></p>
<hr />
<p>It was a very happy family that lived in the
Rectory at Steventon from Seventeen Hundred
Seventy-five to Eighteen Hundred One.
There were five boys and two girls, and the
younger girl's name was Jane. Between her and James,
the oldest boy, lay a period of twelve years of three
hundred and sixty-five days each, not to mention leap-years.</p>

<p>The boys were sent away to be educated, and when
they came home at holiday time they brought presents
for the mother and the girls, and there was great
rejoicing.</p>

<p>James was sent to Oxford. The girls were not sent away
to be educated&mdash;it was thought hardly worth while
then to educate women, and some folks still hold to
that belief. When the boys came home, they were made
to stand by the door-jamb, and a mark was placed on
the casing, with a date, which showed how much they
had grown. And they were catechized as to their knowledge,
and cross-questioned and their books inspected;
and so we find one of the sisters saying, once, that she
knew all the things her brothers knew, and besides that
she knew all the things she knew herself.</p>

<p>There was plenty of books in the library, and the girls
made use of them. They would read to their father
&quot;because his eyesight was bad,&quot; but I can not help
thinking this a clever ruse on the part of the good
Rector.</p>
<p><a name="II_Page_262"></a></p>
<p>I do not find that there were any secrets in that household
or that either Mr. or Mrs. Austen ever said that
children should be seen and not heard. It was a little
republic of letters&mdash;all their own. Thrown in on themselves
for not many of the yeomanry thereabouts
could read, there was developed a fine spirit of comradeship
among parents and children, brothers and
sisters, servants and visitors, that is a joy to contemplate.
Before the days of railroads, a &quot;visitor&quot; was
more of an institution than he is now. He stayed longer
and was more welcome; and the news he brought from
distant parts was eagerly asked for. Nowadays we
know all about everything, almost before it happens,
for yellow journalism is so alert that it discounts
futurity.</p>

<p>In the Austen household had lived and died a son of
Warren Hastings. The lad had so won the love of the
Austens that they even spoke of him as their own; and
this bond also linked them to the great outside world
of statecraft. The things the elders discussed were the
properties, too, of the children.</p>

<p>Then once a year the Bishop came&mdash;came in knee-breeches,
hobnailed shoes, and shovel hat, and the
little church was decked with greens. The Bishop came
from Paradise, little Jane used to think, and once, to
be polite, she asked him how all the folks were in
Heaven. Then the other children giggled and the
Bishop spilt a whole cup of tea down the front of his
<a name="II_Page_263"></a>best coat, and coughed and choked until he was very
red in the face.</p>

<p>When Jane was ten years old there came to live at the
Rectory a daughter of Mrs. Austen's sister. She came
to them direct from France. Her name was Madame
Fenillade. She was a widow and only twenty-two.
Once, when little Jane overheard one of the brothers
say that Monsieur Fenillade had kissed Mademoiselle
Guillotine, she asked what he meant and they would
not tell her.</p>

<p>Now Madame spoke French with grace and fluency,
and the girls thought it queer that there should be two
languages&mdash;English and French&mdash;so they picked up a
few words of French, too, and at the table would
gravely say &quot;Merci, Papa,&quot; and &quot;S'il vous plait,
Mamma.&quot; Then Mr. Austen proposed that at table no
one should speak anything but French. So Madame
told them what to call the sugar and the salt and the
bread, and no one called anything except by its French
name. In two weeks each of the whole dozen persons
who sat at that board, as well as the girl who waited
on table, had a bill-of-fare working capital of French.
In six months they could converse with ease.</p>

<p>And science with all its ingenuity has not yet pointed
out a better way for acquiring a new language than
the plan the Austens adopted at Steventon Rectory.
We call it the &quot;Berlitz Method&quot; now.</p>

<p>Madame Fenillade's widowhood rested lightly upon
<a name="II_Page_264"></a>her, and she became quite the life of the whole household.</p>

<p>One of the Austen boys fell in love with the French
widow; and surely it would be a very stupid country
boy that wouldn't love a French widow like that!</p>

<p>And they were married and lived happily ever afterward.</p>

<p>But before Madame married and moved away she
taught the girls charades, and then little plays, and a
theatrical performance was given in the barn.</p>

<p>Then a play could not be found that just suited, so
Jane wrote one and Cassandra helped, and Madame
criticized and the Reverend Mr. Austen suggested a
few changes. Then it was all rewritten. And this was
the first attempt at writing for the public by Jane
Austen.</p>
<p><a name="II_Page_265"></a></p>
<hr />

<p>Jane Austen wrote four great novels,
&quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; was begun when
she was twenty and finished a year later.
The old father started a course of novel-reading
on his own account in order to fit his mind to
pass judgment on his daughter's work. He was sure it
was good, but feared that love had blinded his eyes,
and he wanted to make sure. After six months' comparison
he wrote to a publisher explaining that he had
the manuscript of a great novel that would be parted
with for a consideration. He assured the publisher that
the novel was as excellent as any Miss Burney, Miss
Edgeworth, or any one else ever wrote.</p>

<p>Now publishers get letters like that by every mail, and
when Mr. Austen received his reply it was so antarctic
in sentiment that the manuscript was stored away in the
garret, where it lay for just eleven years before it found
a publisher. But in the meantime Miss Austen had
written three other novels&mdash;not with much hope that
any one would publish them, but to please her father
and the few intimate friends who read and sighed and
smiled in quiet.</p>

<p>The year she was thirty years of age her father died&mdash;died
with no thought that the world would yet endorse
his own loving estimate of his daughter's worth.</p>

<p>After the father's death financial troubles came, and
something had to be done to fight off possible hungry
wolves. The manuscript was hunted out, dusted, gone
<a name="II_Page_266"></a>over, and submitted to publishers. They sniffed at it and
sent it back. Finally a man was found who was bold
enough to read. He liked it, but wouldn't admit the
fact. Yet he decided to print it. He did so. The reading
world liked it and said so, although not very loudly.
Slowly the work made head, and small-sized London
drafts were occasionally sent by publishers to Miss
Austen with apologies because the amounts were not
larger.</p>

<p>Now, in reference to writing books it may not be amiss
to explain that no one ever said, &quot;Now then, I'll
write a story!&quot; and sitting down at table took up pen
and dipping it in ink, wrote. Stories don't come that
way. Stories take possession of one&mdash;incident after
incident&mdash;and you write in order to get rid of 'em&mdash;with
a few other reasons mixed in, for motives, like
silver, are always found mixed. Children play at keeping
house: and men and women who have loved think
of the things that have happened, then imagine all the
things that might have happened, and from thinking
it all over to writing it out is but a step. You begin one
chapter and write it this forenoon; and do all you may
to banish the plot, the next chapter is all in your head
before sundown. Next morning you write chapter number
two, to unload it, and so the story spins itself out
into a book. All this if you live in the country and have
time to think and are not broken in upon by too much
work and worry&mdash;save the worry of the ever-restless
<a name="II_Page_267"></a>mind. Whether the story is good or not depends upon
what you leave out.</p>

<p>The sculptor produces the beautiful statue by chipping
away such parts of the marble block as are not needed.
Really happy people do not write stories&mdash;they accumulate
adipose tissue and die at the top through fatty
degeneration of the cerebrum. A certain disappointment
in life, a dissatisfaction with environment, is
necessary to stir the imagination to a creative point.
If things are all to your taste you sit back and enjoy
them. You forget the flight of time, the march of the
seasons, your future life, family, country&mdash;all, just as
Antony did in Egypt. A deadly, languorous satisfaction
comes over you. Pain, disappointment, unrest or a joy
that hurts, are the things that prick the mind into
activity.</p>

<p>Jane Austen lived in a little village. She felt the narrowness
of her life&mdash;the inability of those beyond her own
household to match her thoughts and emotions. Love
came that way&mdash;a short heart-rest, a being understood,
were hers. The gates of Paradise swung ajar and she
caught a glimpse of the glories within, and sighed and
clasped her hands and bowed her head in a prayer of
thankfulness.</p>

<p>When she arose from her knees the gates were closed;
the way was dark; she was alone&mdash;alone in a little
quibbling, carping village, where tired folks worked
and gossiped, ate, drank, slept. Her home was pleasant,
<a name="II_Page_268"></a>to be sure, but man is a citizen of the world, not of a
house.</p>

<p>Jane Austen began to write&mdash;to write about these
village people. Jane was tall, and twenty&mdash;not very
handsome, but better, she was good-looking. She looked
good because she was. She was pious, but not too pious.
She used to go calling among the parishioners, visiting
the sick, the lowly, the troubled. Then when Great
Folks came down from London to &quot;the Hall,&quot; she
went with the Rector to call on them too, for the Rector
was servant to all&mdash;his business was to minister: he was
a Minister. And the Reverend George Austen was a
bit proud of his younger daughter. She was just as tall
as he, and dignified and gentle: and the clergyman
chuckled quietly to himself to see how she was the
equal in grace and intellect of any Fine Lady from
London town.</p>

<p>And although the good Rector prayed, &quot;From all
vanity and pride of spirit, good Lord, deliver us,&quot; it
never occurred to him that he was vain of his tall
daughter Jane, and I'm glad it didn't. There is no
more crazy bumblebee gets into a mortal's bonnet than
the buzzing thought that God is jealous of the affection
we have for our loved ones. If we are ever damned, it
will be because we have too little love for our fellows,
not too much.</p>

<p>But, egad! brother, it's no small delight to be sixty
and a little stooped and a trifle rheumatic, and have
<a name="II_Page_269"></a>your own blessed daughter, sweet and stately, comb
your thinning gray locks, help you on with your overcoat,
find your cane, and go trooping with you, hand
in hand, down the lane on merciful errand bent. It's
a temptation to grow old and feign sciatica; and if you
could only know that, some day, like old King Lear,
upon your withered cheek would fall Cordelia's tears,
the thought would be a solace.</p>

<p>So Jane Austen began to write stories about the simple
folks she knew. She wrote in the family sitting-room at
a little mahogany desk that she could shut up quickly
if prying neighbors came in to tell their woes and ask
questions about all those sheets of paper! And all she
wrote she read to her father and to her sister Cassandra.
And they talked it all over together and laughed and
cried and joked over it. The kind old minister thought
it a good mental drill for his girls to write and express
their feelings. The two girls collaborated&mdash;that is to
say, one wrote and the other looked on. Neither girl
had been &quot;educated,&quot; except what their father taught
them. But to be born into a bookish family, and inherit
the hospitable mind and the receptive heart, is better
than to be sent to Harvard Annex. Preachers, like
other folks, sometimes assume a virtue when they
have it not. But George Austen didn't pretend&mdash;he
was. And that's the better plan, for no man can deceive
his children&mdash;they take his exact measurement, whether
others ever do or not&mdash;and the only way to win and
<a name="II_Page_270"></a>hold the love of a child (or a grown-up) is to be frank
and simple and honest. I've tried both schemes.</p>

<p>I can not find that George Austen ever claimed he was
only a worm of the dust, or pretended to be more or
less than he was, or to assume a knowledge that he did
not possess. He used to say: &quot;My dears, I really do
not know. But let's keep the windows open and light
may yet come.&quot;</p>

<p>It was a busy family of plain, average people&mdash;not very
rich, and not very poor. There were difficulties to meet,
and troubles to share, and joys to divide.</p>

<p>Jane Austen was born in Seventeen Hundred Seventy-five;
&quot;Jane Eyre&quot; in Eighteen Hundred Sixteen&mdash;one
year before Jane Austen died.</p>

<p>Charlotte Bronte knew all about Jane Austen, and her
example fired Charlotte's ambition. Both were daughters
of country clergymen. Charlotte lived in the North
of England on the wild and treeless moors, where the
searching winds rattled the panes and black-faced
sheep bleated piteously. Jane Austen lived in the rich
quiet of a prosperous farming country, where bees
made honey and larks nested. The Reverend Patrick
Bronte disciplined his children: George Austen loved
his. In Steventon there is no &quot;Black Bull&quot;; only a little
dehorned inn, kept by a woman who breeds canaries,
and will sell you a warranted singer for five shillings,
with no charge for the cage. At Steventon no red-haired
Yorkshiremen offer to give fight or challenge you to a
<a name="II_Page_271"></a>drinking-bout.</p>

<p>The opposites of things are alike, and
that is why the world ties Jane Eyre and Jane Austen
in one bundle. Their methods of work were totally
different: their effects gotten in different ways. Charlotte
Bronte fascinates by startling situations and
highly colored lights that dance and glow, leading you
on in a mad chase. There's pain, unrest, tragedy in the
air. The pulse always is rapid and the temperature high.</p>

<p>It is not so with Jane Austen. She is an artist in her
gentleness, and the world is today recognizing this
more and more. The stage now works its spells by her
methods&mdash;without rant, cant or fustian&mdash;and as the
years go by this must be so more and more, for mankind's
face is turned toward truth.</p>

<p>To weave your spell out of commonplace events and
brew a love-potion from every-day materials is high
art. When Kipling takes three average soldiers of the
line, ignorant, lying, swearing, smoking, dog-fighting
soldiers, who can even run on occasion, and by telling
of them holds a world in thrall&mdash;that's art! In these
soldiers three we recognize something very much akin
to ourselves, for the thing that holds no relationship
to us does not interest us&mdash;we can not leave the personal
equation out. This fact is made plain in &quot;The
Black Riders,&quot; where the devils dancing in Tophet
look up and espying Steve Crane address him thus:
&quot;Brother!&quot;</p>

<p>Jane Austen's characters are all plain, every-day folks.
<a name="II_Page_272"></a>The work is always quiet. There are no entangling
situations, no mysteries, no surprises.</p>

<p>Now, to present a situation, an emotion, so it will
catch and hold the attention of others, is largely a
knack&mdash;you practise on the thing until you do it well.
This one thing I do. But the man who does this thing
is not intrinsically any greater than those who appreciate
it&mdash;in fact, they are all made of the same kind of
stuff. Kipling himself is quite a commonplace person.
He is neither handsome nor magnetic. He is plain and
manly and would fit in anywhere. If there was a trunk
to be carried upstairs, or an ox to get out of a pit, you'd
call on Kipling if he chanced that way, and he'd give
you a lift as a matter of course, and then go on whistling
with hands in his pockets. His art is a knack practised
to a point that gives facility.</p>

<p>Jane Austen was a commonplace person. She swept,
sewed, worked, and did the duty that lay nearest her.
She wrote because she liked to, and because it gave
pleasure to others. She wrote as well as she could. She
had no thought of immortality, or that she was writing
for the ages&mdash;no more than Shakespeare had. She never
anticipated that Southey, Coleridge, Lamb, Guizot
and Macaulay would hail her as a marvel of insight,
nor did she suspect that a woman as great as George
Eliot would declare her work flawless.</p>

<p>But today strong men recognize her books as rarely
excellent, because they show the divinity in all things,
<a name="II_Page_273"></a>keep close to the ground, gently inculcate the firm belief
that simple people are as necessary as great ones, that
small things are not necessarily unimportant, and that
nothing is really insignificant. It all rings true.</p>

<p>And so I sing the praises of the average woman&mdash;the
woman who does her work, who is willing to be unknown,
who is modest and unaffected, who tries to
lessen the pains of earth, and to add to its happiness.
She is the true guardian angel of mankind!</p>

<p>No book published in Jane Austen's lifetime bore her
name on the title-page; she was never lionized by society;
she was never two hundred miles from home; she
died when forty-two years of age, and it was sixty years
before a biography was attempted or asked for. She
sleeps in the cathedral at Winchester, and not so very
long ago a visitor, on asking the verger to see her grave,
was conducted thither, and the verger asked: &quot;Was
she anybody in particular? So many folks ask where
she's buried, you know!&quot;</p>

<p>But this is changed now, for when the verger took me
to her grave and we stood by that plain black marble
slab, he spoke intelligently of her life and work. And
many visitors now go to the cathedral, only because it
is the resting-place of Jane Austen, who lived a beautiful,
helpful life and produced great art, yet knew it not.

<p>It was a great life, dearie, a great life!
Charles Lamb used to study mathematics
to subdue his genius, and
I'll have to tinge truth with gray
in order to keep this little sketch
from appearing like a red Ruritania
romance.</p>

<p>Josephine was born on an island in
the Caribbean Sea, a long way from France. The Little
Man was an islander, too. They started for France
about the same time, from different directions&mdash;each,
of course, totally unaware that the other lived. They
started on the order of that joker, Fate, in order to
scramble Continental politics, and make omelet of the
world's pretensions.</p>

<p>Josephine's father was Captain Tascher. Do you know
who Captain Tascher was? Very well, there is satisfaction
then in knowing that no one else does either.
He seems to have had no ancestors; and he left no
successor save Josephine.</p>

<p>We know a little less of Josephine's mother than we do
of her father. She was the daughter of a Frenchman
whom the world had plucked of both money and courage,
and he moved to the West Indies to vegetate and
brood on the vanity of earthly ambitions. Young
Captain Tascher married the planter's daughter in the
<a name="II_Page_280"></a>year Seventeen Hundred Sixty-two. The next year a
daughter was born, and they called her name Josephine.</p>

<p>Not long after her birth, Captain Tascher thought to
mend his prospects by moving to one of the neighboring
islands. His wife went with him, but they left the baby
girl in the hands of a good old aunt, until they could
corral fortune and make things secure, for this world at
least.</p>

<p>They never came back, for they died and were buried.</p>

<p>Josephine never had any recollection of her parents.
But the aunt was gentle and kindly, and life was simple
and cheap. There was plenty to eat, and no clothing to
speak of was required, for the Equator was only a
stone's throw away; in fact, it was in sight of the house,
as Josephine herself has said.</p>

<p>There was a Catholic church near, but no school. Yet
Josephine learned to read and write. She sang with the
negroes and danced and swam and played leap-frog.
When she was nine years old, her aunt told her she must
not play leap-frog any more, but she should learn to
embroider and to play the harp and read poetry. Then
she would grow up and be a fine lady.</p>

<p>And Josephine thought it a bit hard, but said she would
try.</p>

<p>She was tall and slender, but not very handsome. Her
complexion was rather yellow, her hands bony. But the
years brought grace, and even if her features were not
pretty she had one thing that was better, a gentle voice.
<a name="II_Page_281"></a>So far as I know, no one ever gave her lessons in voice
culture either. Perhaps the voice is the true index of the
soul. Josephine's voice was low, sweet, and so finely
modulated that when she spoke others would pause to
listen&mdash;not to the words, just to the voice.</p>

<p>Occasionally, visitors came to the island and were
received at the old rambling mansion where Josephine's
aunt lived. From them the girl learned about the great,
outside world with its politics and society and strife
and rivalry; and when the visitor went away Josephine
had gotten from him all he knew. So the young woman
became wise without school and learned without books.
A year after the memorable year of Seventeen Hundred
Seventy-six, there came to the island, Vicomte
Alexander Beauharnais. He had come direct from
America, where he had fought on the side of the Colonies
against the British. He was full of Republican
principles. Paradoxically, he was also rich and idle and
somewhat of an adventurer.</p>

<p>He called at the old aunt's, Madame Renaudin's, and
called often. He fell violently in love with Josephine. I
say violently, for that was the kind of man he was. He
was thirty, she was fifteen. His voice was rough and
guttural, so I do not think he had much inward grace.
Josephine's fine instincts rebelled at thought of accepting
his proffered affection. She explained that she
was betrothed to another, a neighboring youth of
about her own age, whose thoughts and feelings matched
<a name="II_Page_282"></a>hers.</p>

<p>Beauharnais said that was nothing to him, and
appealed to the old folks, displaying his title, submitting
an inventory of his estate; and the old folks agreed to
look into the matter. They did so and explained to
Josephine that she should not longer hold out against
the wishes of those who had done so much for her.</p>

<p>And so Josephine relented and they were married,
although it can not truthfully be said that they lived
happily ever afterward. They started for France, on
their wedding-tour. In six weeks they arrived in Paris.
Returned soldiers and famed travelers are eagerly
welcomed by society; especially is this so when the
traveler brings a Creole wife from the Equator. The
couple supplied a new thrill, and society in Paris is
always eager for a new thrill.</p>

<p>Vicomte Beauharnais and his wife became quite the
rage. It was expected that the Creole lady would be
beautiful but dull; instead, she was not so very beautiful,
but very clever. She dropped into all the graceful ways
of polite society intuitively.</p>

<p>In a year, domestic life slightly interfered with society's
claims&mdash;a son was born. They called his name Eugene.</p>

<p>Two more years and a daughter was born. They called
her name Hortense.</p>

<p>Josephine was only twenty, but the tropics and social
experience and maternity had given ripeness to her life.
She became thoughtful and inclined rather to stay at
home with her babies than chase fashion's butterflies.</p>
<p><a name="II_Page_283"></a></p>
<p>Beauharnais chased fashion's butterflies, and caught
them, too, for he came home late and quarreled with
his wife&mdash;a sure sign.</p>

<p>He drank a little, gamed more, sought excitement, and
talked politics needlessly loud in underground cafes.</p>

<p>Men who are woefully lax in their marriage relations are
very apt to regard their wives with suspicion. If Beauharnais
had been weighed in the balances he would have
been found wanton. He instituted proceedings against
Josephine for divorce.</p>

<p>And Josephine packed up a few scanty effects and
taking her two children started for her old home in the
West Indies. It took all the money she had to pay
passage.</p>

<p>It was the old, old story&mdash;a few years of gay life in the
great city, then cruelty too great for endurance, tears,
shut white lips, a firm resolve&mdash;and back to the old
farm where homely, loyal hearts await, and outstretched
arms welcome the sorrowful, yet glad return.</p>

<p>Beauharnais failed to get his divorce. The court said
&quot;no cause for action.&quot; He awoke, stared stupidly about,
felt the need of sympathy in his hour of undoing, and
looked for&mdash;Josephine.</p>

<p>She was gone.</p>

<p>He tried absinthe, gambling, hot dissipation; but he
could not forget. He had sent away his granary and
storehouse; his wand of wealth and heart's desire. Two
ways opened for peace, only two: a loaded pistol&mdash;or
<a name="II_Page_284"></a>get her back.</p>

<p>First he would try to get her back, and
the pistol should be held in reserve in case of failure.</p>

<p>Josephine forgave and came back; for a good woman
forgives to seventy times seven.</p>

<p>Beauharnais met her with all the tenderness a lover
could command. The ceremony of marriage was again
sacredly solemnized. They retired to the country and
with their two children lived three of the happiest
months Josephine ever knew; at least Josephine said so,
and the fact that she made the same remark about
several other occasions is no reason for doubting her
sincerity. Then they moved back to Paris.</p>

<p>Beauharnais sobered his ambitions, and kept good
hours. He was a soldier in the employ of the king, but
his sympathies were with the people. He was a Republican
with a Royalist bias, but some said he was a
Royalist with a Republican bias.</p>

<p>Josephine looked after her household, educated her
children, did much charitable work, and knew what
was going on in the State.</p>

<p>But those were troublous times. Murder was in the
air and revolution was rife. That mob of a hundred
thousand women had tramped out to Versailles and
brought the king back to Paris. He had been beheaded,
and Marie Antoinette had followed him. The people
were in power and Beauharnais had labored to temper
their wrath with reason. He had even been Chairman
of the Third Convention. He called himself Citizen.
<a name="II_Page_285"></a>But the fact that he was of noble birth was remembered,
and in September of Seventeen Hundred Ninety-three,
three men called at his house. When Josephine looked
out of the window, she saw by the wan light of the moon
a file of soldiers standing stiff and motionless.</p>

<p>She knew the time had come. They marched Citizen
Beauharnais to the Luxembourg.</p>

<p>In a few feverish months, they came back for his wife.
Her they placed in the nunnery of the Carmelites&mdash;that
prison where, but a few months before, a mob relieved
the keepers of their vigils by killing all their charges.</p>

<p>Robespierre was supreme. Now, Robespierre had come
into power by undoing Danton. Danton had helped
lug in the Revolution, but when he touched a match
to the hay he did not really mean to start a conflagration,
only a bonfire.</p>

<p>He tried to dampen the blaze, and Robespierre said he
was a traitor and led him to the guillotine. Robespierre
worked the guillotine until the bearings grew hot. Still,
the people who rode in the death-tumbrel did not seem
so very miserable. Despair pushed far enough completes
the circle and becomes peace&mdash;a peace like unto security.
It is the last stage: hope is gone, but the comforting
thought of heroic death and an eternal sleep takes its
place.</p>

<p>When Josephine at the nunnery of the Carmelites
received from the Luxembourg prison a package containing
a generous lock of her husband's hair, she knew
<a name="II_Page_286"></a>it had been purchased from the executioner.</p>

<p>Now the
prison of the Carmelites was unfortunately rather
crowded. In fact, it was full to the roof-tile. Five ladies
were obliged to occupy one little cell. One of these
ladies in the cell with Josephine was Madame Fontenay.
Now Madame Fontenay was fondly loved by Citizen
Tallien, who was a member of the Assembly over which
Citizen Robespierre presided. Citizen Tallien did not
explain his love for Madame to the public, because
Madame chanced to be the wife of another. So how
could Robespierre know that when he imprisoned
Madame he was touching the tenderest tie that bound
his friend Tallien to earth?</p>

<p>Robespierre sent word to the prison of the Carmelites
that Madame Fontenay and Madame Beauharnais
should prepare for death&mdash;they were guilty of plotting
against the people.</p>

<p>Now, Tallien came daily to the prison of the Carmelites,
not to visit of course, but to see that the prisoners were
properly restrained. A cabbage-stalk was thrown out
of a cell-window, and Tallien found in the stalk a note
from his ladylove to this effect: &quot;I am to die in two
days; to save me you must overthrow Robespierre.&quot;</p>

<p>The next day there was trouble when the Convention
met. Tallien got the platform and denounced Robespierre
in a Cassius voice as a traitor&mdash;the arch-enemy of
the people&mdash;a plotter for self. To emphasize his remarks
he brandished a glittering dagger. Other orations
<a name="II_Page_287"></a>followed in like vein. All orders that Robespierre had
given out were abrogated by acclamation. Two days
and Robespierre was made to take a dose of the medicine
he had so often prescribed for others. He was
beheaded by Samson, his own servant, July Fifteenth,
Seventeen Hundred Ninety-four.</p>

<p>Immediately all &quot;suspects&quot; imprisoned on his instigation were released.</p>

<p>Madame Fontenay and the widow Beauharnais were
free. Soon after this Madame Fontenay became
Madame Tallien. Josephine got her children back from
the country, but her property was gone and she was in
sore straits. But she had friends, yet none so loyal and
helpful as Citizen Tallien and his wife. Their home was
hers. And it was there she met a man by the name of
Barras, and there too she met a man who was a friend
of Barras; by name, Bonaparte&mdash;Napoleon Bonaparte.
Bonaparte was twenty-six. He was five feet two inches
high and weighed one hundred twenty pounds. He was
beardless and looked like a boy, and at that time his
face was illumined by an eruption.</p>

<p>Out of employment and waiting for something to turn
up, he yet had a very self-satisfied manner.</p>

<p>His peculiar way of listening to conversation&mdash;absorbing
everything and giving nothing out&mdash;made one
uncomfortable. Josephine, seven years his senior, did
not like the youth. She had had a wider experience and
been better brought up than he, and she let him know
it, but he did not seem especially abashed.</p>
<p><a name="II_Page_288"></a></p>
<hr />

<p>Exactly what the French Revolution was,
no one has yet told us. Read &quot;Carlyle&quot;
backward or forward and it is grand: it puts
your head in a whirl of heroic intoxication,
but it does not explain the Revolution.</p>

<p>Suspicion, hate, tyranny, fear, mawkish sentimentality,
mad desire, were in the air. One leader was deposed
because he did nothing, and his successor was carried
to the guillotine because he did too much. Convention
after convention was dissolved and re-formed.</p>

<p>On the Fourth of October, Seventeen Hundred Ninety-five,
there was a howl and a roar and a shriek from
forty thousand citizens of Paris.</p>

<p>No one knew just
what they wanted&mdash;the forty thousand did not
explain. Perhaps it was nothing&mdash;only the leaders
who wanted power. They demanded that the Convention
should be dissolved: certain men must be
put out and others put in.</p>

<p>The Convention convened and all the members felt
to see if their heads were in proper place&mdash;tomorrow
they might not be. The room was crowded to suffocation.
Spectators filled the windows, perched on the
gallery-railing, climbed and clung on the projecting
parts of columns.</p>

<p>High up on one of these columns
sat the young man Bonaparte, silent, unmoved, still
waiting for something to turn up.</p>

<p>The Convention must protect itself, and the call was
for Barras. Barras had once successfully parleyed with
<a name="II_Page_289"></a>insurrection&mdash;he must do so again. Barras turned
bluish-white, for he knew that to deal with this mob
successfully a man must be blind and deaf to pity. He
struggled to his feet&mdash;he looked about helplessly&mdash;the
Convention silently waited to catch the words of its
savior.</p>

<p>High up on a column Barras spied the lithe form of the
artillery major, whom he had seen, with face of bronze,
deal out grape and canister at Toulon. Barras raised his
hand and pointing to the young officer cried, &quot;There,
there is the man who can save you!&quot;</p>

<p>The Convention nominated the little man by acclamation
as commander of the city's forces. He slid down
from his perch, took half an hour to ascertain whether
the soldiers were on the side of the mob or against it&mdash;for
it was usually a toss-up&mdash;and decided to accept the
command. Next day the mob surrounded the Tuileries
in the name of Liberty, Fraternity and Equality. The
Terrorists entreated the soldiers to throw down their
arms, then they reviled and cajoled and cursed and
sang, and the women as usual were in the vanguard.
Paris recognized the divine right of insurrection. Who
dare shoot into such a throng!</p>

<p>The young artillery major dare. He gave the word and
red death mowed wide swaths, and the balls spat against
the walls and sang through the windows of the Church
of Saint Roche where the mob was centered. Again and
again he fired. It began at four by the clock, and at six
<a name="II_Page_290"></a>all good people, and bad, had retired to their homes,
and Paris was law-abiding. The Convention named
Napoleon, General of the Interior, and the French Revolution
became from that moment a thing that was.</p>
<p><a name="II_Page_291"></a></p>
<hr />

<p>Of course, no one in Paris was so much talked
of as the young artillery officer. Josephine
was a bit proud that she had met him, and
possibly a little sorry that she had treated
him so coldly. He only wished to be polite!</p>

<p>Josephine was an honest woman, but still, she was a
woman. She desired to be well thought of, and to be well
thought of by men in power. Her son Eugene was
fifteen, and she had ambitions for him; and to this end
she saw the need of keeping in touch with the Powers.
Josephine was a politician and a diplomat, for all women
are diplomats. She arrayed Eugene in his Sunday-best
and told him to go to the General of the Interior and
explain that his name was Eugene Beauharnais, that
his father was the martyred patriot, General Beauharnais,
and that this beloved father's sword was in the
archives over which Providence had placed the General
of the Interior. Furthermore, the son should request
that the sword of his father be given him so that it
might be used in defense of France if need be.</p>

<p>And it was so done.</p>

<p>The whole thing was needlessly melodramatic, and
Napoleon laughed. The poetry of war was to him a joke.
But he stroked the youth's curls, asked after his mother,
and ordered his secretary to go fetch that sword.</p>

<p>So the boy carried the sword home and was very happy,
and his mother was very happy and proud of him, and
she kissed him on both cheeks and kissed the sword
<a name="II_Page_292"></a>and thought of the erring, yet generous man who once
had carried it. Then she thought it would be but proper
for her to go and thank the man who had given the
sword back; for had he not stroked her boy's curls
and told him he was a fine young fellow, and asked
after his mother!</p>

<p>So the next day she went to call on the man who had so
graciously given the sword back. She was kept waiting
a little while in the anteroom, for Napoleon always kept
people waiting&mdash;it was a good scheme. When admitted
to the presence, the General of the Interior, in simple
corporal's dress, did not remember her. Neither did he
remember about giving the sword back&mdash;at least he
said so. He was always a trifler with women, though;
and it was so delicious to have this tearful widow
remove her veil and explain&mdash;for gadzooks! had she not
several times allowed the mercury to drop to zero for
his benefit?</p>

<p>And so she explained, and gradually it all came back to
him&mdash;very slowly and after cross-questioning&mdash;and
then he was so glad to see her. When she went away,
he accompanied her to the outer door, bareheaded, and
as they walked down the long hallway she noted the
fact that he was not so tall as she by three inches. He
shook hands with her as they parted, and said he would
call on her when he had gotten a bit over the rush.</p>

<p>Josephine went home in a glow. She did not like the
man&mdash;he had humiliated her by making her explain
<a name="II_Page_293"></a>who she was, and his manner, too, was offensively
familiar. And yet he was a power, there was no denying
that, and to know men of power is a satisfaction to
any woman. He was twenty years younger than Beauharnais,
the mourned&mdash;twenty years! Then Beauharnais
was tall and had a splendid beard and wore a dangling
sword. Beauharnais was of noble birth, educated,
experienced, but he was dead; and here was a beardless
boy being called the Chief Citizen of France. Well,
well, well!</p>

<p>She was both pleased and hurt&mdash;hurt to think she had
been humbled, and pleased to think such attentions had
been paid her. In a few days the young general called
on the widow to crave forgiveness for not having
recognized her when she had called on him. It was very
stupid in him, very! She forgave him.</p>

<p>He complimented Eugene in terse, lavish terms, and
when he went away kissed Hortense, who was thirteen
and thought herself too big to be kissed by a strange
man. But Napoleon said they all seemed just like old
friends. And seeming like old friends he called often.</p>

<p>Josephine knew Paris and Parisian society thoroughly.
Fifteen years of close contact in success and defeat with
statesmen, soldiers, diplomats, artists and literati had
taught her much. It is probable that she was the most
gifted woman in Paris. Now, Napoleon learned by
induction as Josephine had, and as all women do, and
as genius must, for life is short&mdash;only dullards spend
<a name="II_Page_294"></a>eight years at Oxford. He absorbed Josephine as the
devilfish does its prey. And to get every thought and
feeling that a good woman possesses you must win her
completest love. In this close contact she gives up all&mdash;unlike
Sapphira&mdash;holding nothing back.</p>

<p>Among educated people, people of breeding and culture,
Napoleon felt ill at ease. With this woman at his side
he would be at home anywhere. And feeling at once that
he could win her only by honorable marriage he decided
to marry her.</p>

<p>He was ambitious. Has that been
remarked before? Well, one can not always be original&mdash;still
I think the facts bear out the statement.</p>

<p>Josephine was ambitious, too, but some way in this
partnership she felt that she would bring more capital
into the concern than he, and she hesitated.</p>

<p>But power had given dignity to the Little Man; his face
had taken on the cold beauty of marble. Success was
better than sarsaparilla. Josephine was aware of his
growing power, and his persistency was irresistible; and
so one evening when he dropped in for a moment, her
manner told all. He just took her in his arms, and kissing
her very tenderly whispered, &quot;My dear, together we
will win,&quot; and went his way. When he wished to be,
Napoleon was the ideal lover; he was master of that
fine forbearance, flavored with a dash of audacity, that
women so appreciate. He never wore love to a frazzle,
nor caressed the object of his affections into fidgets;
neither did he let her starve, although at times she
<a name="II_Page_295"></a>might go hungry.</p>

<p>However, the fact remains that
Josephine married the man to get rid of him; but
that's a thing women are constantly doing.</p>

<p>The ceremony was performed by a Justice of the Peace,
March Ninth, Seventeen Hundred Ninety-six. It was
just five months since the bride had called to thank the
groom for giving back her husband's sword, and fifteen
months after this husband's death. Napoleon was
twenty-seven; Josephine was thirty-three, but the
bridegroom swore he was twenty-eight and the lady
twenty-nine. As a fabricator he wins our admiration.</p>

<p>Twelve days after the marriage, Napoleon set out for
Italy as Commander-in-Chief of the army. To trace the
brilliant campaign of that year, when the tricolor of
France was carried from the Bay of Biscay to the
Adriatic Sea, is not my business. Suffice it to say that it
placed the name of Bonaparte among the foremost
names of military leaders of all time. But amid the
restless movement of grim war and the glamour of success
he never for a day forgot his Josephine. His letters
breathe a youthful lover's affection, and all the fond
desires of his heart were hers. Through her he also
knew the pulse and temperature of Paris&mdash;its form and
pressure.</p>

<p>It was a year before they saw each other. She came on
to Milan and met him there. They settled in Montebello,
at a beautiful country seat, six miles from the city.
From there he conducted negotiations for peace&mdash;and
<a name="II_Page_296"></a>she presided over the gay social circles of the ancient
capital. &quot;I gain provinces; you win hearts,&quot; said
Napoleon. It was a very Napoleonic remark.</p>

<p>Napoleon had already had Eugene with him, and
together they had seen the glory of battle. Now Hortense
was sent for, and they were made Napoleon's
children by adoption. These were days of glowing sunshine
and success and warm affection.</p>

<p>And so Napoleon with his family returned to France
amid bursts of applause, proclaimed everywhere the
Savior of the State, its Protector, and all that. Civil
troubles had all vanished in the smoke of war with
foreign enemies. Prosperity was everywhere, the fruits
of conquest had satisfied all, and the discontented class
had been drawn off into the army and killed or else was
now cheerfully boozy with success.</p>

<p>Napoleon made allies of all powers he could not easily
undo, and proffered his support&mdash;biding his time.
Across the English Channel he looked and stared with
envious eyes. Josephine had tasted success and known
defeat. Napoleon had only tasted success. She begged
that he would rest content and hold secure that which
he had gained. Success in its very nature must be
limited, she said. He laughed and would not hear of it.
For the first time she felt her influence over him was
waning. She had given her all; he greedily absorbed,
and now had come to believe in his own omniscience.
He told her that on a pinch he could get along without
<a name="II_Page_297"></a>her&mdash;within himself he held all power. Then he kissed
her hand in mock gallantry and led her to the door, as
he would be alone.</p>

<p>When Napoleon started on the Egyptian campaign,
Josephine begged to go with him; other women went,
dozens of them. They seemed to look upon it as a picnic
party. But Napoleon, insisting that absence makes the
heart grow fonder, said his wife should remain behind.</p>

<p>Josephine was too good and great for the wife of such a
man. She saw through him. She understood him, and
only honest men are willing to be understood. He was
tired of her, for she no longer ministered to his vanity.
He had captured her, and now he was done with her.
Besides that, she sided with the peace party, and this
was intolerable. Still he did not beat her with a stick;
he treated her most graciously, and installing her at
beautiful Malmaison, provided her everything to make
her happy. And if &quot;things&quot; could make one happy,
she would have been.</p>

<p>And as for the Egyptian campaign, it surely was a
picnic party, or it was until things got so serious that
frolic was supplanted by fear. You can't frolic with your
hair on end like quills upon the fretful porcupine.
Napoleon did not write to his wife. He frolicked.
Occasionally his secretary sent her a formal letter of
instruction, and when she at last wrote him asking an
explanation for such strange silence, the Little Man
answered her with accusations of infidelity.</p>
<p><a name="II_Page_298"></a></p>
<p>Josephine decided to secure a divorce, and there is
pretty good proof that papers were prepared; and had
the affair been carried along, the courts would have at
once allowed the separation on statutory grounds.
However, the papers were destroyed, and Josephine
decided to live it out. But Napoleon had heard of these
proposed divorce proceedings and was furious. When
he came back, it was with the intention of immediate
legal separation&mdash;in any event separation.</p>

<p>He came back and held out haughtily for three days,
addressing her as &quot;Madame,&quot; and refusing so much as
to shake hands. After the three days he sued for peace
and cried it out on his knees with his head in her lap.
It was not genuine humility, only the humility that
follows debauch. Napoleon had many kind impulses,
but his mood was selfish indifference to the rights or
wishes of others. He did not hold hate, yet the thought
of divorce from Josephine was palliated in his own
mind by the thought that she had first suggested it.
&quot;I took her at her word,&quot; he once said to Bertram, as if
the thing were pricking him.</p>

<p>And so matters moved on. There was war, and rumors
of war, alway; but the vanquished paid the expenses.
It was thought best that France should be ruled by
three consuls. Three men were elected, with Napoleon
as First Consul. The First Consul bought off the Second
and Third Consuls and replaced them with two wooden
men from the Tenth Ward.</p>

<p>Josephine worked for the
<a name="II_Page_299"></a>glory of France and for her husband: she was diplomat
and adviser. She placated enemies and made friends.</p>

<p>France prospered, and in the wars the foreigner usually
not only paid the bills, but a goodly tribute beside.
Nothing is so good as war to make peace at home. An
insurrectionist at home makes a splendid soldier abroad.
Napoleon's battles were won by the &quot;dangerous class.&quot;
As the First Consul was Emperor in fact, the wires were
pulled, and he was made so in name. His wife was made
Empress: it must be so, as a breath of disapproval
might ruin the whole scheme. Josephine was beloved by
the people, and the people must know that she was
honored by her husband. With a woman's intuition,
Josephine saw the end&mdash;power grows until it topples.
She pleaded, begged&mdash;it was of no avail&mdash;the tide swept
her with it, but whither, whither? she kept asking.</p>

<p>Meantime Hortense had been married to Louis, brother
of Napoleon. In due time Napoleon found himself a
grandfather. He both liked it and didn't. He considered
himself a youth and took a pride in being occasionally
mistaken for a recruit, and here some newspaper had
called him &quot;granddaddy,&quot; and people had laughed!
He was not even a father, except by law&mdash;not Nature&mdash;and
that's no father at all, for Nature does not recognize
law. He joked with Josephine about it, and she
turned pale.</p>

<p>There is no subject on which men so deceive themselves
as concerning their motives for doing certain
<a name="II_Page_300"></a>things. On no subject do mortals so deceive themselves
as their motives for marriage. Their acts may be all
right, but the reasons they give for doing them never
are. Napoleon desired a new wife, because he wished a
son to found a dynasty.</p>

<p>&quot;You have Eugene!&quot; said Josephine.</p>

<p>&quot;He's my son by proxy,&quot; said Napoleon, with a weary smile.</p>

<p>All motives, like ores, are found mixed, and counting the
whole at one hundred, Napoleon's desire for a son after
the flesh should stand as ten&mdash;other reasons ninety. All
men wish to be thought young. Napoleon was forty,
and his wife was forty-seven. Talleyrand had spoken
of them as Old Mr. and Mrs. Bonaparte.</p>

<p>A man of forty is only a giddy youth, according to his
own estimate. Girls of twenty are his playfellows. A
man of sixty, with a wife forty, and babies coming, is
not old&mdash;bless me! But suppose his wife is nearly
seventy&mdash;what then! Napoleon must have a young
wife. Then by marrying Marie Louise, Austria could be
held as friend: it was very necessary to do this. Austria
must be secured as an ally at any cost&mdash;even at the cost
of Josephine. It was painful, but must be done for the
good of France. The State should stand first in the mind
of every loyal, honest man: all else is secondary.</p>

<p>So Josephine was divorced, but was provided with an
annuity that was preposterous in its lavish proportions.
It amounted to over half a million dollars a year.
I once knew a man who, on getting home from the club
<a name="II_Page_301"></a>at two o'clock in the morning, was reproached by his
wife for his shocking condition. He promptly threw the
lady over the banisters. Next day he purchased her a
diamond necklace at the cost of a year's salary, but she
could not wear it out in society for a month on account
of her black eye.</p>

<p>Napoleon divorced Josephine that he might be the
father of a line of kings. When he abdicated in Eighteen
Hundred Fifteen, he declared his son, the child of Marie
Louise, &quot;Napoleon the Second, Emperor of France,&quot;
and the world laughed. The son died before he had
fairly reached manhood's estate. Napoleon the Third,
son of Hortense, Queen of Holland, the grandson of
Josephine, reigned long and well as Emperor of France.
The Prince Imperial&mdash;a noble youth&mdash;great-grandson
of Josephine, was killed in Africa while fighting the
battle of the nation that undid Napoleon.</p>

<p>Josephine was a parent of kings: Napoleon was not.</p>

<p>When Bonaparte was banished to Elba, and Marie
Louise was nowhere to be seen, Josephine wrote to him
words of consolation, offering to share his exile.</p>

<p>She died not long after&mdash;on the Second of June,
Eighteen Hundred Fourteen.</p>

<p>After viewing that gaudy tomb at the Invalides, and
thinking of the treasure in tears and broken hearts
that it took to build it, it will rest you to go to the simple
village church at Ruel, a half-hour's ride from the Arc de
Triomphe, where sleeps Josephine, Empress of France.

<p>When Emerson borrowed from Wordsworth
that fine phrase about plain
living and high thinking, no one was
more astonished than he that Whitman
and Thoreau should take him
at his word. He was decidedly
curious about their experiment. But
he kept a safe distance between
himself and the shirt-sleeved Walt; and as for Henry
Thoreau&mdash;bless me! Emerson regarded him only as a
fine savage, and told him so. Of course, Emerson loved
solitude, but it was the solitude of a library or an
orchard, and not the solitude of plain or wilderness.
Emerson looked upon Beautiful Truth as an honored
guest. He adored her, but it was with the adoration of
the intellect. He never got her tag in jolly chase of
comradery; nor did he converse with her, soft and low,
when only the moon peeked out from behind the silvery
clouds, and the nightingale listened. He never laid himself
open to damages. And when he threw a bit of a
bomb into Harvard Divinity School it was the shrewdest
bid for fame that ever preacher made.</p>

<p>I said &quot;shrewd&quot;&mdash;that's the word.</p>

<p>Emerson had the instincts of Connecticut&mdash;that peculiar
development of men who have eked out existence on
a rocky soil, banking their houses against grim Winter
<a name="II_Page_308"></a>or grimmer savage foes. With this Yankee shrewdness
went a subtle and sweeping imagination, and a fine
appreciation of the excellent things that men have said
and done. But he was never so foolish as to imitate the
heroic&mdash;he, simply admired it from afar. He advised
others to work their poetry up into life, but he did not
do so himself. He never cast the bantling on the rocks,
nor caused him to be suckled with the she-wolf's teat.
He admired &quot;abolition&quot; from a distance. When he
went away from home it was always with a return
ticket. He has summed up Friendship in an essay as no
other man ever has, and yet there was a self-protective
aloofness in his friendship that made icicles gather, as
George William Curtis has explained.</p>

<p>In no relation of his life was there a complete abandon.
His &quot;Essay on Self-Reliance&quot; is beef, iron and wine,
and &quot;Works and Days&quot; is a tonic for tired men; and
yet I know that, in spite of all his pretty talk about
living near Nature's heart, he never ventured into the
woods outside of hallooing distance from the house.
He could neither ride a horse, shoot, nor sail a boat&mdash;and
being well aware of it, never tried. All his farming
was done by proxy; and when he writes to Carlyle late
in life, explaining how he is worth forty thousand dollars,
well secured by first mortgages, he makes clear one-half
of his ambition.</p>

<p>And yet, I call him master, and will match my admiration
for him 'gainst that of any other, six nights and
<a name="II_Page_309"></a>days together. But I summon him here only to contrast
his character with that of another&mdash;another who, like
himself, was twice married.</p>

<p>In his &quot;Essay on Love&quot; Emerson reveals just an
average sophomore insight; and in his work I do not
find a mention or a trace of influence exercised by either
of the two women he wedded, nor by any other woman.
Shelley was what he was through the influence of the
two women he married.</p>

<p>Shelley wrecked the life of one of these women. She
found surcease of sorrow in death; and when her body
was found in the Serpentine he had a premonition that
the hungry waves were waiting for him, too. But before
her death and through her death, she pressed home to
him the bitterest sorrow that man can ever know: the
combined knowledge that he has mortally injured a
human soul and the sense of helplessness to minister
to its needs. Harriet Westbrook said to Shelley, drink
ye all of it. And could he speak now he would say that
the bitterness of the potion was a formative influence as
potent as that of the gentle ministrations of Mary
Wollstonecraft, who broke over his head the precious
vase of her heart's love and wiped his feet with the
hairs of her head.</p>

<p>In the poetic sweetness, gentleness, lovableness and
beauty of their natures, Emerson and Shelley were very
similar. In a like environment they would have done
the same things. A pioneer ancestry with its struggle
<a name="II_Page_310"></a>for material existence would have given Shelley caution;
and a noble patronymic, fostered by the State, lax in
its discipline, would have made Emerson toss discretion
to the winds.</p>

<p>Emerson and Shelley were both apostles of the good,
the true and the beautiful. One of them rests at Sleepy
Hollow, his grave marked by a great rough-hewn
boulder, while overhead the winds sigh a requiem
through the pines. The ashes of the other were laid
beneath the moss-grown wall of the Eternal City, and
the creeping vines and flowers, as if jealous of the white,
carven marble, snuggle close over the spot with their
leaves and petals.</p>

<p>Yet both of these men achieved immortality, for their
thoughts live again in the thoughts of the race, and their
hopes and their aspirations mingle and are one with the
men and women of earth who think and feel and dream.</p>
<p><a name="II_Page_311"></a></p>
<hr />

<p>It was Mary Wollstonecraft Godwin who
awoke in Shelley such a burst of song that
men yet listen to its cadence. It was she who
gave his soul wings: her gentle spirit blending
with his made music that has enriched the world.
Without her he was fast beating out his life against the
bars of unkind condition, but together they worked and
sang. All his lines were recited to her, all were weighed
in the critical balances of her woman's judgment. She
it was who first wrote it out, and then gave it back.
Together they revised; and after he had passed on, she
it was who collected the scattered leaves, added the
final word, and gave us the book we call &quot;Shelley's
Poems.&quot; Perhaps we might call all poetry the child of
parents, but with Shelley's poems this is literally true.
Mary Shelley delighted in the name Wollstonecraft. It
was her mother's name; and was not Mary Wollstonecraft
the foremost intellectual woman of her day&mdash;a
woman of purpose, forceful yet gentle, appreciative,
kind?</p>

<p>Mary Wollstonecraft was born in Seventeen Hundred
Fifty-nine; and tiring of the dull monotony of a country
town went up to London when yet a child and fought
the world alone. By her own efforts she grew learned;
she had all science, all philosophy, all history at her
fingers' ends. She became able to speak several languages,
and by her pen an income was secured that was
not only sufficient for herself, but ministered to the
<a name="II_Page_312"></a>needs of an aged father and mother and sisters as well.</p>

<p>Mary Wollstonecraft wrote one great book (which is
all any one can write): &quot;A Vindication of the Rights of
Woman.&quot; It sums up all that has since been written on
the subject. Like an essay by Herbert Spencer, it
views the matter from every side, anticipates every
objection&mdash;exhausts the subject. The literary style of
Mary Wollstonecraft's book is Johnsonese, but its
thought forms the base of all that has come after. It is
the great-great-grandmother of all woman's clubs and
these thousand efforts that women are now putting
forth along economic, artistic and social lines. But we
have nearly lost sight of Mary Wollstonecraft. Can
you name me, please, your father's grandmother? Aye,
I thought not; then tell me the name of the man who
is now Treasurer of the United States!</p>

<p>And so you see we do not know much about other
people, after all. But Mary Wollstonecraft pushed the
question of woman's freedom to its farthest limit; I
told you that she exhausted the subject. She prophesied
a day when woman would have economic freedom&mdash;that
is, be allowed to work at any craft or trade for
which her genius fitted her and receive a proper recompense.
Woman would also have social freedom: the
right to come and go alone&mdash;the privilege of walking
upon the street without the company of a man&mdash;the
right to study and observe. Next, woman would have
political freedom: the right to record her choice in
<a name="II_Page_313"></a>matters of lawmaking. And last, she would yet have
sex freedom: the right to bestow her love without
prying police and blundering law interfering in the
delicate relations of married life.</p>

<p>To make herself understood. Mary Wollstonecraft
explained that society was tainted with the thought
that sex was unclean; but she held high the ideal that
this would yet pass away, and that the idea of holding
one's mate by statute law would become abhorrent to
all good men and women. She declared that the assumption
that law could join a man and a woman in holy
wedlock was preposterous, and that the caging of one
person by another for a lifetime was essentially barbaric.
Only the love that is free and spontaneous and that
holds its own by the purity, the sweetness, the tenderness
and the gentleness of its life is divine. And further,
she declared it her belief that when a man had found
his true mate such a union would be for life&mdash;it could
not be otherwise. And the man holding his mate by the
excellence that was in him, instead of by the aid of the
law, would be placed, loverlike, on his good behavior,
and be a stronger and manlier being. Such a union,
freed from the petty, spying and tyrannical restraints
of present usage, must come ere the race could far
advance.</p>

<p>Mary Wollstonecraft's book created a sensation. It was
widely read and hotly denounced. A few upheld it:
among these was William Godwin. But the air was so
<a name="II_Page_314"></a>full of taunt and threat that Miss Wollstonecraft
thought best to leave England for a time. She journeyed
to Paris, and there wrote and translated for certain
English publishers. In Paris she met Gilbert Imlay, an
American, seemingly of very much the same temperament
as herself. She was thirty-six, he was somewhat
younger. They began housekeeping on the ideal basis.
In a year a daughter was born to them. When this baby
was three months old, Imlay disappeared, leaving Mary
penniless and friendless.</p>

<p>It was a terrible blow to this trusting and gentle woman.
But after a good cry or two, philosophy came to her
rescue and she decided that to be deserted by a man
who did not love her was really not so bad as to be
tied to him for life. She earned a little money and in a
short time started back for England with her babe and
scanty luggage&mdash;sorrowful, yet brave and unsubdued.
She might have left her babe behind, but she scorned
the thought. She would be honest and conceal nothing.
Right must win.</p>

<p>Now, I am told that an unmarried woman with a babe
at her breast is not received in England into the best
society. The tale of Mary's misfortune had preceded
her, and literary London laughed a hoarse, guttural
guffaw, and society tittered to think how this woman
who had written so smartly had tried some of her own
medicine and found it bitter. Publishers no longer
wanted her work, old friends failed to recognize her,
<a name="II_Page_315"></a>and one man to whom she applied for work brought a
rebuke upon his head, that lasted him for years.</p>

<p>Godwin, philosopher, idealist, enthusiast and reformer,
who made it his rule to seek out those in trouble, found
her and told a needless lie by declaring he had been
commissioned by a certain nameless publisher to get
her to write certain articles about this and that. Then
he emptied his pockets of all the small change he had,
as an advance payment, and he hadn't very much,
and started out to find the publisher who would buy the
prospective &quot;hot stuff.&quot; Fortunately he succeeded.</p>

<p>After a few weeks, Mr. Godwin, bachelor, aged forty,
found himself very much in love with Mary Wollstonecraft
and her baby. Her absolute purity of purpose, her
frankness, honesty and high ideals surpassed anything
he had ever dreamed of finding incarnated in woman.
He became her sincere lover; and she, the discarded,
the forsaken, reciprocated; for it seems that the tendrils
of affection, ruthlessly uprooted, cling to the first object
that presents itself.</p>

<p>And so they were married; yes, these two who had so
generously repudiated the marriage-tie were married
March Twenty-ninth, Seventeen Hundred Ninety-seven,
at Old Saint Pancras Church, for they had
come to the sane conclusion that to affront society
was not wise.</p>

<p>On August Thirtieth, in the year Seventeen Hundred
Ninety-seven, was born to them a daughter. Then the
<a name="II_Page_316"></a>mother died&mdash;died did brave Mary Wollstonecraft, and
left behind a girl baby one week old. And it was this
baby, grown to womanhood, who became Mary Wollstonecraft
Shelley.</p>
<p><a name="II_Page_317"></a></p>
<hr />

<p>William Godwin wrote one great book:
&quot;Political Justice.&quot; It is a work so high and
noble in its outlook that only a Utopia could
ever realize its ideals. When men are everywhere
willing to give to other men all the rights they
demand for themselves, and co-operation takes the
place of competition, then will Godwin's philosophy be
not too great and good for daily food. Among the many
who read his book and thought they saw in it the portent
of a diviner day was one Percy Bysshe Shelley.</p>

<p>And so it came to pass that about the year Eighteen
Hundred Thirteen, this Percy Bysshe Shelley called
on Godwin, who was living in a rusty, musty tenement
in Somerstown. The young man was twenty: tall and
slender, with as handsome a face as was ever given to
mortal. The face was pale as marble: the features almost
feminine in their delicacy: thin lips, straight nose, good
teeth, abundant, curling hair, and eyes so dreamy and
sorrowful that women on the street would often turn
and follow the &quot;angel soul garbed in human form.&quot;</p>

<p>This man Shelley was sick at heart, bereft, perplexed, in
sore straits, and to whom should he turn for advice in
this time of undoing but to Godwin, the philosopher!
Besides, Godwin had been the husband of Mary Wollstonecraft,
and the splendid precepts of these two had
nourished into being all the latent excellence of the youth.
Yes, he would go to Godwin, the Plato of England!</p>

<p>And so he went to Godwin.</p>
<p><a name="II_Page_318"></a></p>
<p>Now, this young man Shelley was of noble blood. His
grandfather was Sir Bysshe Shelley, Bart., and worth
near three hundred thousand pounds, all of which
would some day come to our pale-faced youth. But the
youth was a republican&mdash;he believed in the brotherhood
of man. He longed to benefit his fellows, to lift
them out of the bondage of fear, and sin, and ignorance.
After reading Hume, and Godwin, and Wollstonecraft,
he had decided that Christianity as defined by the
Church of England was a failure: it was only an organized
fetish, kept in place by the State, and devoid of
all that thrills to noble thinking and noble doing.</p>

<p>And so young Shelley at Oxford had written a pamphlet
to this end, explaining the matter to the world.</p>

<p>A copy being sent to the headmaster of the school,
young Shelley was hustled off the premises in short
order, and a note was sent to his father requesting that
the lad be well flogged and kept several goodly leagues
from Oxford.</p>

<p>Shelley the elder was furious that his son should so
disgrace the family name, and demanded he should
write another pamphlet supporting the Church of
England and recanting all the heresy he had uttered.
Young Percy replied that conscience would not admit
of his doing this. The father said conscience be blanked:
and further used almost the same words that were used
by Professor Jowett some years later to a certain
skeptical youth.</p>
<p><a name="II_Page_319"></a></p>
<p>Professor Jowett sent for the youth and said, &quot;Young
man, I am told that you say you can not find God. Is
this true?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, sir,&quot; said the youth.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, you will please find Him before eight o'clock
tonight or get out of this college.&quot;</p>

<p>Shelley was not allowed to return home, and moreover
his financial allowance was cut off entirely.</p>

<p>And so he wandered up to London and chewed the cud
of bitter fancy, resolved to starve before he would
abate one jot or tittle of what he thought was truth.
And he might have starved had not his sisters sent him
scanty sums of money from time to time. The messenger
who carried the money to him was a young girl by the
name of Harriet Westbrook, round and smooth and
pink and sixteen. Percy was nineteen. Harriet was the
daughter of an innkeeper and did not get along very
well at home. She told Percy about it, and of course she
knew his troubles, and so they talked about it over the
gate, and mutually condoled with each other.</p>

<p>Soon after this Harriet had a fresh quarrel with her
folks; and with the tears yet on her pretty lashes ran
straight to Shelley's lodging and throwing herself into
his arms proposed that they cease to fight unkind Fate,
and run away together and be happy ever afterward.</p>

<p>And so they ran away.</p>

<p>Shelley's father instanced this as another proof of
depravity and said, &quot;Let 'em go!&quot; The couple went
<a name="II_Page_320"></a>to Scotland. In a few months they came back from
Scotland, because no one can really be happy away
from home. Besides they were out of money&mdash;and
neither one had ever earned any money&mdash;and as the
Westbrooks were willing to forgive, even if the Shelleys
were not, they came back. But the Westbrooks were
only willing to forgive in consideration of Percy and
Harriet being properly married by a clergyman of the
Church of England. Now, Shelley had not wavered in
his Godwin-Wollstonecraft theories, but he was chivalrous
and Harriet was tearful, and so he gracefully
waived all private considerations and they were duly
married. It was a quiet wedding.</p>

<p>In a short time a baby was born.</p>

<p>Harriet was amiable, being healthy and having very
moderate sensibilities. She had no opinion on any subject,
and in no degree sympathized with Shelley's wild
aspirations. She thought a title would be nice, and
urged that her husband make peace by renouncing his
&quot;infidelity.&quot; Literature was silly business anyway, and
folks should do as other folks did. If they didn't, lawks-a-daisy!
there was trouble!!</p>

<p>And so, with income cut off, banished from home, from
school, out of employment, with a wife who had no
sympathy with him&mdash;who could not understand him&mdash;whose
pitiful weakness stung him and wrung him, he
thought of Godwin, the philosopher: for at the last
philosophy is the cure for all our ills.</p>
<p><a name="II_Page_321"></a></p>
<p>Godwin was glad to see Shelley&mdash;Godwin was glad to
see any one. Godwin was fifty-five, bald, had a Socratic
forehead, was smooth-cheeked, shabby and genteel.
Yes, Godwin was the author of &quot;Political Justice&quot;&mdash;but
that was written quite a while before, twenty years!</p>

<p>One of the girls was sent out for a quart of half-and-half,
and the pale visitor cast his eyes around this
family room, which served for dining-room, library and
parlor. Godwin had married again&mdash;Shelley had heard
that, but he was a bit shocked to find that the great
man who was once mate to Mary Wollstonecraft had
married a shrew. The sound of her high-pitched voice
convinced the visitor at once that she was a very
commonplace person.</p>

<p>There were three girls and a boy in the room, busy at
sewing or reading. None of them was introduced, but
the air of the place was Bohemian, and the conversation
soon became general. All talked except one of the girls:
she sat reading, and several times when the young man
glanced over her way she was looking at him. Shelley
stayed an hour, spending a very pleasant time, but as
he had no opportunity of stating his case to the philosopher
he made an engagement to call again.</p>

<p>As he groped his way downstairs and walked homewards
he mused. The widow Clairmont, whom Godwin
had married, was a worldling, that was sure; her daughter
Jane was good-looking and clever, but both she and
Charles, the boy, were the children of their mother&mdash;he
<a name="II_Page_322"></a>had picked them out intuitively. The little young
woman with brown eyes and merry ways was Fanny
Godwin, the first child of Mary Wollstonecraft and
adopted daughter of Godwin. The tall slender girl who
was so very quiet was the daughter of Godwin and
Mary Wollstonecraft.</p>

<p>&quot;Ye gods, what a pedigree!&quot; said Shelley.</p>

<p>The young man called again, and after explaining his
situation was advised to go back home and make peace
with his wife and father at any cost of personal intellectual
qualms. Philosophy was all right; but life was
one thing and philosophy another. Live with Harriet
as he had vowed to do&mdash;love was a good deal glamour,
anyway; write poetry, of course, if he felt like it, but
keep it to himself. The world was not to be moved by
enthusiastic youth. Godwin had tried it&mdash;he had been
an enthusiastic youth himself, and that was why he
now lived in Somerstown instead of Piccadilly. Move
in the line of least resistance.</p>

<p>Shelley went away shocked and stunned. Going by Old
Saint Pancras Church he turned back to step in a
moment and recover his scattered senses. He walked
through the cool, dim, old building, out into the churchyard,
where toppling moss-covered gray slabs marked
the resting-places of the sleeping dead. All seemed so
cool and quiet and calm there! The dead are at rest: they
have no vexatious problems.</p>

<p>A few people were moving about, carelessly reading the
<a name="II_Page_323"></a>inscriptions. The young man unconsciously followed
their example; he passed slowly along one of the walks,
scanning the stones. His eye fell upon the word &quot;Wollstonecraft,&quot;
marked on a plain little slate slab. He
paused and, leaning over removed his hat and read,
and then glancing just beyond, saw seated on the grass&mdash;the
tall girl. She held a book in her hands, but she
was looking at him very soberly. Their eyes met, and
they smiled just a little. The young man sat down on
the turf on the other side of the grave from the girl,
and they talked of the woman by whose dust they
watched: and the young man found that the tall girl
was an Ancestor-Worshiper and a mystic, and moreover
had a flight of soul that held him in awe. Besides, in
form and feature, she was rarely beautiful. She was
quiet, but she could talk.</p>

<p>The next day, as Percy Shelley strolled through the
churchyard of Old Saint Pancras, the tall girl was there
again with her book, in the same place.</p>
<p><a name="II_Page_324"></a></p>
<hr />

<p>When Shelley made that first call at the Godwins
he was twenty. The three girls he met
were fifteen, sixteen and seventeen, respectively.
Mary being the youngest in years, but
the most mature, she would have easily passed for the
oldest. Now, all three of these girls were dazzled by the
beauty and grace and intellect of the strange, pale-faced
visitor.</p>

<p>He came to the house again and again during the next
few months. All the girls loved him violently, for that's
the way girls under eighteen often love. Mr. Godwin
soon discovered the fact that all his girls loved Shelley.
They lost appetite, and were alternately in chills of fear
and fevers of ecstacy. Mr. Godwin, being a kind man
and a good, took occasion to explain to them that
Mr. Shelley was a married man, and although it was
true he did not live on good terms with his wife, yet
she was his lawful wife, and marriage was a sacred
obligation: of course, pure philosophy or poetic justice
took a different view, but in society the marriage-tie
must not be held lightly. In short, Shelley was married
and that was all there was about it.</p>

<p>Shelley still continued to call, coming via Saint Pancras
Church. In a few months, Mary confided to Jane that
she and Shelley were about to elope, and Jane must
make peace and explain matters after they were gone.</p>

<p>Jane cried and declared she would go, too&mdash;she would
go or die: she would go as servant, scullion&mdash;anything,
<a name="II_Page_325"></a>but go she would. Shelley was consulted, and to prevent
tragedy consented to Jane going as maid to Mary, his
well-beloved.</p>

<p>So the trinity eloped. It being Shelley's second elopement,
he took the matter a little more coolly than did
the girls, who had never eloped before. Having reached
Dover, and while waiting at a hotel for the boat, the
landlord suddenly appeared and breathlessly explained
to Shelley, &quot;A fat woman has just arrived and swears
that you have run away with her girls!&quot;</p>

<p>It was Mrs. Godwin.</p>

<p>The party got out by the back way and hired a
small boat to take them to Calais. They embarked in
a storm, and after beating about all night, came in
sight of France the next morning as the sun arose.</p>

<p>Godwin was very much grieved and shocked to think
that Shelley had broken in upon established order and
done this thing. But Shelley had read Godwin's book
and simply taken the philosopher at his word: &quot;The
impulses of the human heart are just and right; they
are greater than law, and must be respected.&quot;</p>

<p>The runaways seemed to have had a jolly time in
France as long as their money lasted. They bought a
mule to carry their luggage, and walked. Jane's feet
blistered, however, and they seated her upon the luggage
upon the mule, and as the author of &quot;Queen Mab&quot;
led the patient beast, Mary with a switch followed
behind. After some days Shelley sprained his ankle,
<a name="II_Page_326"></a>and then it was his turn to ride while Mary led the
mule and Jane trudged after.</p>

<p>Thus they journeyed for six weeks, writing poetry,
discussing philosophy; loving, wild, free and careless,
until they came to Switzerland. One morning they
counted their money and found they had just enough
to take them to England.</p>

<p>Arriving in London the Godwins were not inclined to
take them back, and society in general looked upon
them with complete disfavor.</p>

<p>Shelley's father was now fully convinced of his son's
depravity, but doled out enough money to prevent
actual starvation. Shelley began to perceive that any
man who sets himself against the established order&mdash;the
order that the world has been thousands of years
in building up&mdash;will be ground into the dust. The old
world may be wrong, but it can not be righted in a day,
and so long as a man chooses to live in society he must
conform, in the main, to society usages. These old ways
that have done good service all the years can not be
replaced by the instantaneous process. If changed at
all they must change as man changes, and man must
change first. It is man that must be reformed, not
custom.</p>

<p>Shelley and Mary Godwin were mates if ever such
existed. In a year Mary had developed from a child
into splendid womanhood&mdash;a beautiful, superior, earnest
woman. By her own efforts, of course aided by
<a name="II_Page_327"></a>Shelley (for they were partners in everything), she
became versed in the classics and delved deeply into
the literature of a time long past. Unlike her mother,
Mary Shelley could do no great work alone. The sensitiveness
and the delicacy of her nature precluded that
self-reliant egoism which can create. She wrote one
book, &quot;Frankenstein,&quot; which in point of prophetic
and allegorical suggestion stamps the work as classic:
but it was written under the immediate spell of Shelley's
presence. Shelley also could not work alone, and without
her the world's disfavor must have whipped him
into insanity and death.</p>

<p>As it was they sought peace in love and Italy, living
near Lord Byron in great intimacy, and befriended by
him in many ways.</p>

<p>But peace was not for Shelley. Calamity was at the
door. He could never forget how he had lifted Harriet
Westbrook into a position for which she was not fitted
and then left her to flounder alone. And when word
came that Harriet had drowned herself, his cup of woe
was full. Shortly before this, Fanny Godwin had gone
away with great deliberation, leaving an empty laudanum-bottle
to tell the tale.</p>

<p>On December Thirtieth, Eighteen Hundred Sixteen,
Shelley and Mary Godwin were married at Saint
Mildred's Church, London. Both had now fully concluded
with Godwin that man owes a duty to the
unborn and to society, and that to place one's self
<a name="II_Page_328"></a>in opposition to custom is at least very bad policy.
But although Shelley had made society tardy amends,
society would not forgive; and in a long legal fight to
obtain possession of his children, Ianthe and Charles,
of whom Harriet was the mother, the Court of Chancery
decided against Shelley, on the grounds that he was
&quot;an unfit person, being an atheist and a republican.&quot;</p>

<p>About this time was born little Allegra, &quot;the Dawn,&quot;
child of Lord Byron and Jane Clairmont. Then afterwards
came bickerings with Byron and threats of a
duel and all that.</p>

<p>Finally there was a struggle between Byron and Miss
Clairmont for the child: but death solved the issue and
the beautiful little girl passed beyond the reach of either.</p>

<p>And so we find Shelley's heart wrung by the sorrows
of others and by his own; and when Mary and he laid
away in death their bright boy William and their baby
girl Clara, the Fates seemed to have done their worst.
But man seems to have a certain capacity for pain, and
beyond this even God can not go.</p>

<p>Shelley struggled on and with Mary's help continued
to write.</p>

<p>Another babe was born and the world grew brighter.
They were now on the shores of the Mediterranean
with a little group of enthusiasts who thought and felt
as they did. For the first time they realized that, after
all, they were a part of the world, and linked to the
human race&mdash;not set off alone, despised, forsaken.</p>
<p><a name="II_Page_329"></a></p>
<p>Then to join their little community were coming Leigh
Hunt and his wife&mdash;Leigh Hunt, who had lain in prison
for the right of free thought and free speech. What a joy
to greet and welcome such a man to their home!</p>

<p>And so Shelley, blithe and joyous, sailed away to meet
his friend. But Shelley never came back to his wife and
baby boy. A few days after, the waves cast his body up
on the beach, and you know the rest&mdash;how the faithful
Trelawney and Byron made the funeral-pyre and reduced
the body to ashes.</p>

<p>Mary was twenty-six years old then. She continued to
live&mdash;to live only in the memory of her Shelley and
with the firm thought in her mind that they would be
united again. She seemed to exist but to care for her
boy, and to do as best she could the work that Shelley
had left undone.</p>

<p>The boy grew into a fine youth, and was as devoted to
his mother as she was to him. The title of the estate
with all its vast wealth descended to him, and together
she lived out her days, tenderly cared for to the last,
dying in her son's arms, aged fifty-four.</p>

<p>She has told us that the first sixteen years of her life
were spent in waiting for her Shelley, eight years she
lived with him in divinest companionship, and twenty-eight
years she waited and worked to prepare herself
to rejoin him.</p>

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project

Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
